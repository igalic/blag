# New blog, new everything

Last Friday I announced I would dismantle my blog and split it up into a personal (this one) and a technical one (at [brainsware.org](http://brainsware.org)).

There are a couple of reasons for this, but leading the top of the list is my growing frustration with Wordpress.
I'm a Unix hacker, who spends most of his day in vim and on the console.
Using a browser to write or edit text feels unnatural to me.
That's why my new blog is made up of hand-created text-files.
They can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/igalic/blag/tree/master/_posts).
Soâ€¦ if you discover a spelling mistake send me a pull-request.
But you can also just fork or-reuse the text, as per the CreativeCommons license below!

If you follow that GitHub link, you may notice that this blog is a direct fork of [bacon-site](https://github.com/Brainsware/bacon-site), the repository holding the [baconphp.net](http://baconphp.net/) website.
BaconPHP is Brainsware's new baby, and our first attempt at *doing* Open Source.
Even though I'm "just" an admin, I'd like to participate more in bacon - but of course I need a project for that, and now I have one.

Finally, I'm planning to do weekly updates.
While this means that many posts will be a roundup of links I've read that week with my commentary, or things that didn't fit into a tweet, those are actually formats I aspire: they are useful collections of my thoughts, which is what this blog ultimately is.
You can expect the first of such link-roundups tomorrow Tuesday, and then every Tuesday.

That's all folks!
