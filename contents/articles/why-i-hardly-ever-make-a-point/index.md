# Why I hardly ever make a point

While my mind is a whirlwind of thoughts, my speech often is a stutter of words.
Until I get started, then it often matches my thoughts.
A bit more eloquently, I hope.

People often tell me to "Cut the chase," to "Get to the point."

Well for one, I'm either too young or too old be in a hurry.
So I won't cut the chase.
As for the other..

> We are four dimensional beings, who only can move unidirectionally and mostly involuntarily through the time part of space-time. Of the three dimensions of space we can only really travel two. While we perceive and store this world in full spectrum, our **conscious** mind can only handle three dimensions at best - and yet we record our world only in two dimensions most of the time.

I arrived at these conclusions perhaps through the wisdoms of Albert Einstein, who once said:

> The horizon of many people is a circle with zero radius which they call their point of view.

You see, communication is always a dialogue.
If I'm struggling or avoiding to make a point, then because I don't want to force my point of view on you.

If I'm chasing my thoughts, I invite you to a chase with me. - I hope I'll learn something along the way.
I hope I'll broaden my horizon.
