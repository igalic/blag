# The Town of Bridges
I'm glad to have visited this curious town of bridges in which both, people and signs always seem to tell you to go right over there - no matter what directions you're inquiring of them.

All the cities on my journey so far have been lashed with rain - in Mostar it has been a most pleasant surprise: The rain lead me to the [war photo exhibition](http://www.warphoto-bih.com "Izlozba ratnih fotografija grada Mostara"). Yet I'm glad I saw it. Most of the exclusively black and white pictures where sad - or saddening. Others shone with hope and strength: Women, mothers, making it through the day and making sure their kids do too.

The main reason I have avoided the exhibition was because of the many ruins of war I have seen in this town and in Sarajevo, too. While some of them stink of piss and beer, most of them - especially here in Mostar are undergrown overgrown with plants. Looking at them gives me a strange soothing feeling. I feared that going to the exhibition would change that. It has not.

These houses, destroyed by war, abandoned, conquered by time and plants are an indication of what will be left of us, once we are gone.

And yet they are beautiful to look at, because they are filled with life - and sometimes someone fills them with music.
