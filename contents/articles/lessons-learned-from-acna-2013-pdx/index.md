# Lessons learned from ACNA 2013 PDX
With my second speaking gig done I think I now have enough of an experience to reflect and analyze the good, the bad and the awful of [ACNA13](http://na.apachecon.com/).

I’m a SysAdmin by trade and I like to consider myself fairly good at it too. I work really well [Under Pressure](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a01QQZyl-_I). I respond great to challenges and can even be funny at times! As a teacher I am patient to a fault and can answer the stupidest of questions 15 times in a lesson. However, if you really want to see me stutter and stumble awkwardly for almost an hour, put me on a podium, in the blinding spotlight where I can’t see my audience and don’t interrupt me and don’t ask me any questions..

After finding my happy place during the course of the last year I am now far more comfortable *leaving* my comfort zone. Public speaking was one of these attempts to step outside, and wow, do I suck at this. (To answer this rhetorical question, in case you’re wondering: Yes, I do suck at this, and pretty hard too).

Going back to the point I first made: As systems administrator I get woken up by calls at night that the site is down and we’re losing money. I get interrupted in the middle of a highly concentrated hacking session by a colleague because something is broken that they can’t figure out on their own. I’d really like to believe that it’s not the microphone, and the cameras or the spotlight. But the wide open space, and the silent void of a faceless, sparsely seated audience really gets me. And it gets at a level that, while stressful, feels physically entirely different from, say a fire in the Datacenter:

I work *really* well [Under Pressure](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a01QQZyl-_I).

Another thing I’m finding out the hard way for the second time around is that it’s extremely valuable to work on your own machine during a presentation: Everyone has their own special setup - and even if that setup is the default Ubuntu or OS X installation - if I’m not used to it, it’ll be useless to me. The challenge here was actually a technical one: My laptop only has a MicroHDMI output. I guess it’s finally time to bite that bullet and buy a new machine.. Perhaps one with battery life \>= 2h.. Oh, or how about the **right** [adapter](http://geizhals.at/samsung_aa-ah2nmhb_e_a885482.html).

The talk that I think went really well was my Introduction to Traffic Server, which I turned into an ad-hoc panel. More importantly I have decided to declare this - upfront - as a panel next time around. Of course the biggest feat that we want to achieve here is promoting [Apache Traffic Server](http://trafficserver.apache.org) - or caching proxy servers in general. Maybe we shouldn’t call it Introducing Traffic Server, but rather “Speeding up HTTP”, and invite our Apache Httpd friends in on the party. I spent a lot of time cheer-leading Traffic Server outside of my tutorial and my talks. But what I really want is a faster Web. We have hundreds of Projects at Apache. Dozens of them use HTTP as protocol - and every single one of those can benefit from caching.

A few notes on traveling: Having a direct flight is pretty awesome, but being able to travel at all is an immeasurable privilege, and all I only have to pay for it is money and a jet lag. Having backup (clothes) has, once again paid off. Having friends’ phone numbers and remembering what city they live in would’ve been even better. Fixing that right now.

A few personal notes: I missed Portland so much and felt a little bit down leaving it again so early - but a whole week of wearing pants (and hence not getting any real work done) is bloody awful. I also missed my girlfriend and would love to share Portland with her next time (so.. in not quite half a year for OSCon ;)

Hearing the book recommendation “Getting to Yes” feels strange on levels I cannot put into words when it comes from someone who has had serious, traumatizing issues in her past with people failing to “Understand No”. Reviving someone’s birthday because she spent that actual date in the cancer ward stirs yet another part: Much like alcohol, cancer runs deep in my family, and as a friend put it: You were able to control alcohol, but you can’t control cancer.

Speaking of alcohol: Watching a friend get (metaphorically) pissed (and almost literally piss himself) was an instantly sobering experience for some who feared he could have had alcohol poisoning. But thethought of alcohol poisoning didn’t even cross mind. It was too preoccupied trying to picture what problems my friend wanted to talk about, and why he needed that much scotch to even try to start... :|

* * * * *

Much better than giving talks I am at *actually* talking to people. As part of my cheer-leading for [ATS](http://trafficserver.apache.org) this part is most obvious - and, the one I consider the most important aspect of a conference with the breadth of topics and people that ApacheCon has. This way, and this way only was I able to learn about things I otherwise would have had no chance of learning: [OpenHatch](https://openhatch.org/) and [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) - just to name-drop two (technical) things.

But I also got to catch up with many people (and probably missed catching up with many others :( And this is exactly why I’m looking forward to a next visit in Portland. Be it for a conference, or otherwise.

Maybe I’ll just follow [this advise](https://twitter.com/zwoop/status/306072380290240512)
