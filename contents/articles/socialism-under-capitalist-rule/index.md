yup. While Marx might have laid out the ground-work with one of the best
documentations of capitalism, it's feminists who keep pointing out the dismal
state of affairs. While most of my communist⚡feminist rants go uncommented,
this one was met with a reply

I tried to clarify,

Sam had a reply for this,

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en">

So i promised him a longer, more coherent reply. Three or so days ago.
let's see if I can distill my thoughts on the subject, while making myself
understood:

First off, I disagree with Sam, that "socialism under capitalism advances all
by asking everyone to share the costs". And the reason why I disagree is that
taxes primarily target *work*, never *capital*. Capital has a way of protecting
itself, justifying its own existence…

If we consider the point I was trying to make that "capitalism is fundamentally
built on inequality", and when we look at how this supposedly, and *actually*
pans out:

* existing inequality is supposed to "incentivise" (holy fuck do I hate this
  word) a rise from the bottom to the top.

* this rise is made extraordinarily hard by the fact that *work is taxed*, while
  *capital is not*

* this is easy to forget, and remain forgotten, thanks to
  [survivor bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias): once a
  capitalist made it, they are convinced that the system works

There is that saying that "time is money", and, for the poorest of the poor
that is definitely st definitely true:

People earning minimum wage often find themselves unable to afford public, or
any kind of transport; this forces them to walk to work. These walks can get
quite long, when you consider where the poorest of the poor live vs where jobs
*exist*. Those poorest of the poor, are the only ones "willing" to take on
minimum wage jobs. If we allow for "willing" to mean "having no other choice
but"… and these people live in *vastly* different areas of a city, thanks to
city planning.

Poor people are also the last people to be involved in city planning.  Not just
because they have no "influence". Influence isn't just money to afford a
bus-ride to attend a town-hall meeting. It's also a connection to anyone, who
has information about when such meetings take place, where we will discuss the
gentrification of yet another ghetto area (and the displacement of all of its
inhabitants). Finally, influence also means having been around for a while.

People who have to walk to a shitty, low-paying job, for which they are still
taxed, don't have a voice in how we're shaping our communities, because they
don't have money, time, connections, information, and, education.

This is why i disagree with "sharing" in capitalism. That's why i think that
capital is built on inequality, and why i merely think that, while the
incentive to rise to the top is a noble idea, which in the past has brought us
interesting results. The same past has also showed that capital ***must***
protect itself. (if you're not into Marx, go read Piketty). These protection
mechanisms have societal consequences:

* displacement for cheep realestate
* slave-like labour at farms in, e.g., spain, mostly by undocumented people - these
  people too, like the ones in my above example cannot rise from their
  position. they can only survive.
* the potential for "rising" also has consequences: education is constantly
  under-funded, while jobs require hire, and hire qualifications

It's interesting how capitalism relies on labour so much, while devaluing at
any front possible. minimum wage means exactly that…

It's to keep the poor poor. To keep a work-force around. Both, in form of [wage
slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery) for the "gainfully"
employed, as well as in the form of a [reserve army of
labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_army_of_labour) for the
unemployed. The latter is fascinating, and worth a read.

Yes, but what about Deleuze?

How does Deleuze's nomadology fit into this?

I dunno, it's probably got to do with vectors…
