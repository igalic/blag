Can you believe that there are people out there who complain about LGBT being
too PC? And about how adding more letters to this alphabet soup is just PC gone
wild. I for one, don't believe in "too PC". I believe in being inclusive as
fuck. Because life is *way* short for anything else.

My favourite flavour of alphabet soup is QUILTBAG. I don't even remember where
I first stumbled across the phrase, I'd just like to save it here in this space
as a reminder for myself.

## Q
- Q is for Queer
- Q is for Questioning â€” one's gender, or one's sexuality

## U
- U is for Undecided

## I
- I is for Intersex

## L
- L is for Lesbian

## T
- T is for Transgender
- T is for Transsexual

## B
- B is for Bisexual

## A
- A is for Agender
- A is for Asexual

## G
- G is for Gay

I guess that most people who identify with one of those letters will identify
with more than one.  Mine are Q and B.
