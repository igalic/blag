# Vacation

So I saw this girl in a bar when a friend and I were passing for a quick beer refill, and before we left I gave her my card and told her to call me sometime.

Well she didn't.
She just mailed me.
Asking me if we couldn't go for a drink sometime.
In her home-town. In London.

Why not?
I'm on vacation and I need something to fill in the hole between Vienna and Budapest anyways.
So in replying to her last e-mail, I crafted my plan for the vacation, and here it goes:

- Play tourist in Vienna
- (14th flight to LON)  Play tourist in London
- Go by train to the north and see the country
- (17th flight to ZAG over BUD) Visit family in Rovinj, go for swim in the adria
- Visit family in Banja Luka
- (21st) Chill at a friend's house in Budapest

Sometimes it does help to have people bugg you, otherwise I'd probably be without a plan and just drifting.
Well, now I'm drifting *with* a plan!

I'm already looking forward to seeing [Don Giovanni](http://www.theater-wien.at/index.php/de/spielplan/production/9920 "Theater an der Wien - Don Giovanni")!
This will be a first time for me being in an Opera.

I'll keep you updated, should I manage getting to a computer with internet connection now and then.
