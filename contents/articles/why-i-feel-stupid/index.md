# Why I feel stupid

Sometimes I have discussions with people and emerge from them with a feeling of helplessness and stupidity simply because I had to argue against things such as, "Cancer has only existed for 50 years."

Recently I had an exchange with a young American woman, and thanks to an awful headache it was only the next day that I realized the extent of ignorance I had experienced.

> She brought up the topic of Obamacare allowing for young women to have a sterilization without parental consent.

I understand this as a form of indirectly attacking Obama by criticizing his healthcare program, but I had to wonder: Why this?

Of course we could argue that with her 22 years she's [young](http://www.politicususa.com/16-year-old-assassinate-president.html).
But then again, she's legally allowed to drink, drive and vote in the US, and for the sake of other citizens I hope she chooses not to do those at the same time.

More critically: She has a bachelors degree, and is working on her masters.
Which makes me wonder: How is it possible to enter, and *successfully* leave a university without knowing a thing about statistics? Or worse: Without having aquired critical thinking?

Given the prevalence of ignorance towards statistics (from me too, no less), we shall dissect this argument using just words:

- The ability to have a sterilization is a tiny part among other contraceptive methods offered in the [Women's Preventive Services](http://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/).
  Which, again, are just a tiny part of the whole package offered by the Affordable Care Act.
- A part of the population will indeed take this offer.
  Part of those women[^1] will, indeed, be of very young age.
- Of those people, there is chance that *some* will, indeed, regret this decision.
  Especially if they decided to go for a method that is non-reversible[^2]

With this additional information in mind, we can now ask ourselves a simple question:

> Is allowing young women to have a sterilization without parental a good enough reason for the only modern country without affordable healthcare to reject the such a program?

[^1]: Yes, women, not birthing factories
[^2]: Yes, I know: Even the reversible methods sometimes are non-reversible.
