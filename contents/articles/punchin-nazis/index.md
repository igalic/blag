I often have discussions with friends whom I'll give the benefit of doubt, and
talk about sensitive subjects, such as whether it's okay to punch Nazis, and
when, exactly, it's okay to punch Nazis.

The results of one such recent discussion can be read here.

## The Two Kinds

A common argument is that violence leads to nothing (or to more violence) and as
such should only be applied as last resort.  That is, when Nazis pose a direct
threat to you or your friends. This is a line of arguing I would generally agree
with, if there wasn't more than one kind of Nazi.

For simplicity, let's call this one the

### Skin Head

This is usually someone who grew up poor, and was early on indoctrinated that the
*other* is bad. Is cause for their poverty and misfortune in life. For their
suffering and their grief. The Skin Head will frequently pose a direct threat to
your skin or kin. And in those situations, I encourage you to punch them.

Ironically enough, when they don't pose a direct threat to you, they are more
likely to be convinced of your humanity. You can *actually* talk to **them**, or
otherwise show them that you two have much more in common than they do with the

### Fascist

who grew up rich, and was early on indoctrinated that the *other* is bad. Is a
threat to their prosperity and fortune in life. For their *potential* suffering
and grief. The Fascist rarely poses a *direct* threat to your life. Unless they
are surrounded by a group of Skin Heads. In this case, I suggest to walk up to the
Fascist and punch them in face. If you really care, make sure they don't go
unconscious so they can witness the cowardice of their Skin Head friends, as
they follow your advise to run.

This might be a frequent occurrence in juveniles, but later in life the Fascist
will move on to broader network.

What kind of violence is it when a person invests their time and (often
considerable) wealth for political activism? Political activism that declares
you, your friends and family not only as unwelcome, but as *not people*.
Non-citizens.

No amount of talking will convince someone who has dedicated their life to
political activism *against* **your humanity** of the opposite.

When you meet this person, punching them is not just okay, I highly encourage it!

However, if you have the means, I also suggest ensuring to do everything in your
might that they don't get a platform anywhere close to you area of influence.
