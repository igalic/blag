# There and back again: Stockholm

> Dependency. Hate. Responsibility. Pity. Misunderstanding.

It's abuse.
Emotional, physical and psychological abuse that binds all of those together to an awesome bundle.
By now both of my loyal readers should know that I grew up in an abusive household.
The past two weeks I've been trying my best to "objectively" lay out the pros and cons of Stockholm Syndrome.

If this whole thing reads schizophrenic to you, well, fuck you.
Writing this shit was hard.
So here we go.

## The Things I Remember

- Independently in different phases of my life, both, my therapist and my mother asked me if there was anything positive about my relationship with with my parents I could remember.
  I gave it a long hard think, and after five minutes of my being still they prompted me again.
  I just sadly shook my head.

- One of the earliest memories I have of my mother is her crying and shouting while hitting me because I made a hole in my pants - taking a shortcut to buy milk for my baby brother.
  (He, age 0; me, age 4)

- One of the earliest pictures of my father I have is him coming back from a long time working abroad: After a short conversation with my mother, he unbuckles his belt, and, turning to me whips it down.
  His arm feels a mile long.
  The leather feels like hot metal rain.
  He dares me not to cry.

- When my uncle dies (commits suicide? Who knows? Certainly no one talks about it) the only picture I have of him is one of a guy with an impressive beard.
  He looks like Jesus - and, like Jesus, he died aged 33.
  Aged 5, I come back home from shopping for my baby brother.
  I'm happy and I share my thoughts with my mother:

  > "I was talking with someone back way home" "Who?", she asks. "Ghosts," I say, still smiling. "Who?!", she asks, more sternly or irritated, I cannot tell. "Uncle. Uncle Radomir," I say, a bit surprised.

  She unleashes a beating on me I do not expect, nor forget.
  This day I stop believing in god.
  I never tell her that, it would break her heart.

- It's war and I don't even really know.
  I'm a kid of six or seven, but that's a bad excuse.
  How much older is my cousin when he finds an anti-person grenade and it takes away his left hand? How much more stable is his mother before, how much less stable afterwards? Talking to my aunt over the phone, broken and panicking my mother has lost all power and so have I.
  I am eight years old and I am absolutely powerless.
  I want to crawl up the walls, literally because I'm still afraid my father will hit me with his belt if he finds me crying.
  He's not even here.
  I feel even more powerless than she does.
  I love her.
  I don't know how to support her.

- Thirteen and I'm angry.
  I bang doors when I leave - at least when I leave in anger.
  There's no one in the world who's stronger, scarier or more dangerous than me.

- I don't remember what I did, but my mother takes me to their bedroom and brings her cooking spoon.
  She beats it over my head until it breaks and she starts crying.
  I look her in the eye.
  I don't cry.
  She says something, and I tell her I'll never forget that.
  I don't remember what she said, but I remember that I decide to fuck the pain.
  Fuck all feelings.
  I'll just ignore them.

- I'm 19 and I'm crazy.
  In fact I don't know, but the crazy part is: I don't care.
  I'm as stable as Nitroglycerine and as likely to make friends - but also perfectly ignorant of all of this.

- I don't remember what he says or does, but something prompts me to stop talking to my father.
  Sometimes we convey messages through my mother, but most of the time he tells me things and I don't respond.
  I'm very good at this, far better than he is.
  I respond to words as little as I do to beatings.
  After a year or so he decides I'm too stubborn to be bettered with beatings and gives up on it.
  A small victory.

- I'm 17 and ready to fight your sorry ass and everyone else's.
  Fuck you.

- My grandfather is dead.
  It's cancer and I still smoke.
  My cousin is holding his obituary.
  It's beautifully written and it's breaking my heart.
  His voice is trembling so much while tears run down his cheeks.
  His and those over every man and woman at the funeral.
  Seeing how my father and my brother are crying, I "know" that I must remain the strong man in my family, since no one else does: I don't cry.
  What a load of bullshit.

- 21 and it's my first burn-out.
  Still at school and I don't believe it.
  Three months in and I'm still lying in bed.
  My parents help me and I don't even know how.
  I'm thankful.
  A decade later my mother tells me it was "just" two weeks.

- I'm 22 and I promise myself I'll never be dependant again.
  I have no idea what I'm talking about - I only have determinism.

## Things You Cannot Flee From

- You and yourself and the monsters within
- The guilt that has been instilled in you that you believe is responsibility
- Your crooked idea of what love is and other toxic concepts
- Pity is caring
- Gratefulness is lifelong debt
- Hate is criticism
- Emotions are weakness
- Self imposed ideas and limitations
- The past that haunts you, the bad blood that binds you.
- Everyone you think you love and everyone you think loves you
- The skewed narrative you created for your life

## Futility

In my mind there's a constant tug-o-war that goes back and forth every couple of weeks: When I come back from visiting my parents I do so with a sinking feeling.
After they said something, directly or indirectly that hurt me, or undermined my values, my self worth, my believes, my morality.
I think about ending it all and then I remember how much I would hurt my family and my friends if I did.
It wouldn't even have to be suicide.
Just moving away, starting anew.
At times that thought feels like an impossible step to take.
Other times it feels weak or cowardly or just plain wrong:

Because these people love you.
Even if they do things that frightens or hurts you, they do it because they love you.
If you tell them it hurts, you're hurting them, so you're careful with everything you do and everything you say.

It feels selfish to pursue my happiness, so I stay.

## Things You Don't Want to Flee From

I grew up taking care of my brother.
I went shopping for him, changed his diapers, I took care of him while my parents were at work, once we all moved to Vienna.
I took the beatings for him while he was too small, and later too.
I tended him when he was sick, went to parent-teacher meetings when my mother was busy with work, I took care of him after school.
Unfortunately, I also (indirectly?) introduced him to violence and drugs.

My brother and I moved together at the age of 17 and 13, respectively.
The apartment was on the same floor as my parents, but it was a different apartment! I moved out when I landed my first real job at the age of 22.
I moved out because I couldn't stand playing his maid any longer, nor could I stand watching his mental state deteriorate.
(It's interesting, because it was him who wanted to move out as soon as he landed his first job, and being in an apprenticeship, he landed his first job years before me.)

My brother is mentally unstable, prone to depression, is manipulative, addicted, paranoid and anti-social.
My parents beg me to help them help him.
Yet, every attempt of mine to help him, he repels.
Maybe I'm doing it wrong.
Probably, I'm doing it wrong.
In a way he often times reminds me of my father.

I don't know if it was me who corrupted him, but for the longest time he was the reason I didn't want to leave the country, break contact with my family, etc.
I still had hope that I somehow could "save" my little baby brother.
Unfortunately, his teenage rebellion didn't stop with his parents, or rather, it simply extended to me, who for a big chunk of his life had a parental role in his life.

## Looking Back in Anger

The list of essential life lessons I did not learn seem endless.
At times I wonder how I managed to survive thus far.
I'm catching up, though: I have relearned to appreciate physical contact - even physical intimacy and sex.
All that is left to learn is to appreciate emotional intimacy and (re?)learn what love is.

My earlier attempts at this were rather simple minded.
I would drink.
Drink so much until I'd lost control over my emotions.
Or rather, until I loosened my controlling grip on them.
In the end the only thing I really lost control over was my drinking itself.
It didn't help that I (thought myself into believing I) had a "safe-word" that would instantly make me sober.
Thus my latest step on this journey has been to give up drinking.
Thereby force myself to experience reality as it is.
Process emotions, mine and others', as they are.
Instead of drinking up the courage to talk to someone, I now just talk to people.

It's a first step in a dangerous direction, yet I cannot stop thinking,

> This path is no escape route. There is no escape.

I don't wonder where these thoughts of futility come from, I know exactly.

I now also know that I cannot "save" anybody.
I can *maybe* save myself.
If, and only if, I accomplish that, can I even start thinking about helping someone elseâ€¦ like my brother.
This is the thought that leaves me shivering and alone and hopeless.
This is the power of the bad blood that binds.

## Death is Not The End

One of my teachers once said:

> Your family problems only end when the family members you're having problems with dies.

My therapists disagrees with that notion, and lately I've come to side with her: Death does not give you closure.
Whether or not a family member is alive is irrelevant for that.
The only one who can give you closure is you and you only! (Unless you're Batman and refusing yourself closure is part of your existenceâ€¦)

You know that the only death that can free you is your own, but that is part of what's binding you: You also know that you are loved and needed.
You cannot - you must not leave.

## The Advantages of Stockholm Syndrome

I promised you pros and cons, but so far all of this sounded rather negative, so here's some pros:

- Humour. Really, sometimes I it's the only thing that keeps me alive.
- Sarcasm. But of course that's not true: I live on air and love.
- Amazing, trans-psychic experiences. That's what you get from fleeing into drugs.
- Friends and lovers. As fucked up as you are, because likes attract.
- Inhuman tolerance for pain. Except for waxing. That shit still hurts like fuck.
- Kinky sex-life. You cannot grow up in abuse, without havingâ€¦ an interesting relationship with your pleasure zones.

## Transformation

There is one talent I possess that I have been most proud of: My almost uncanny ability to transform myself.
Be that a [look](http://twitter.yfrog.com/g0ve5ypj "Helloween, I'm the one on the right."), or a character trait, if I put my mind behind it I am able to mould myself into it.
This powerful force has kept me alive in hiding.
I used it to restore myself when I fled my cave.
For too long have I pretended to be powerless.
It's time I step forward and use my power of transformation to fully and unapologetically realize myself as the person that I am.

Today I don't know how.
But tomorrowâ€¦ Tomorrow I'll become me.
