# Reading List Tuesday: On a Wednesday

Yesterday was a busy day.
I LEARNED HOW TO WRITE PUPPET TESTS (which is something I'll write about in another space) and went with fellow Unix admins on a BBQ - where we would be food for mosquitoes.
So despite having enough material for this weekly column I didn't really get around putting it in place.
Something we'll change right this second!

## PRISM wrap-up

I'd like to wrap up for myself the whole paranoia about PRISM.
Moxie Marlinspike wants to remind everyone that [We should all have something to hide](http://www.thoughtcrime.org/blog/we-should-all-have-something-to-hide/).
If you can spare some 40 minutes you should also watch [his talk at DEFCON18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG0KrT6pBPk)

> What is the difference between a government mandated tracking device and a mobile phone?
>
> Choice.
>
> (And you pay for it)

Once you're done soaking all that up, you should do something to fix it: <http://prism-break.org/> and <http://fixtracking.com/> are good starting points.

As always, an enlightening write-up by Karl Fogel.

Speaking of Copyright and Open Source licensing, [MySQL's man pages were silently relicensed away from GPL](https://blog.mariadb.org/mysql-man-pages-silently-relicensed-away-from-gpl/).
More sad proof that Oracle isn't really the best company to be trusted with Open Source.

## Science

[Hank Greenly shares his thoughts](http://blogs.law.stanford.edu/lawandbiosciences/2013/06/13/a-side-note-on-amp-v-myriad-genetics-the-curious-concurrence-of-justice-antonin-scalia/) on the case of [AMP v. Myriad Genetics](http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2013/06/13/a-closer-look-at-supreme-courts-decision-on-gene-patenting/) and quoting this marvelous passage from C.P. Snow 1959 book "The Two Cultures"

> A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who, by the standards of the traditional culture, are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists.
> Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
> The response was cold: it was also negative.
> Yet I was asking something which is the scientific equivalent of: *Have you read a work of Shakespeare’s?*
>
> I now believe that if I had asked an even simpler question — such as, What do you mean by mass, or acceleration, which is the scientific equivalent of saying, *Can you read?* — not more than one in ten of the highly educated would have felt that I was speaking the same language.
> So the great edifice of modern physics goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the western world have about as much insight into it as their Neolithic ancestors would have had.

On a lighter note Mike Osborne tries to answer the question [Are we screwed?](http://www.stanford.edu/group/anthropocene/cgi-bin/wordpress/essay-how-am-i-supposed-to-answer-are-we-screwed/).
Everyone on The Internet instantly agrees that this is the way how to do science writing:

> climate is context, and that’s what we’re changing.
> It’s like putting Pulp Fiction in New York instead of LA.
> It’s a whole different movie when you change the setting.
> Scientists can’t tell us how the story ends.
> All we can say is that the setting is going to be different.

I'm inclined to agree (:

Not always is science moving us forward in time.
Sometimes it's stepping backwards.
For good.
In this [Ancient Roman Concrete has been reverse engineered](http://mobile.businessweek.com/articles/2013-06-14/ancient-roman-concrete-is-about-to-revolutionize-modern-architecture).
It's sturdier (you know, surviving all those millennia) and greener than anything we have managed to come up with.

## (Open Source) "Community" and "Culture"

That the Open Source community has their black sheep (note the fantastic euphemisms) is [well documented](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Geek_Feminism_Wiki) by now, and thanks to the "massive" feminist movements more light is shown into dark corners at conferences and more and more conferences are being pressured into adopting a code of conduct.
In InfoSec community that seems to be lagging behind.
Georgia Weidman shares her [terrifying and sad and upsetting encounter](http://georgiaweidman.com/wordpress/guess-you-thought-i-was-someone-to-mess-with/).

On another spectrum, Gina Trapani shares her thoughts on what makes or breaks an OSS community for *everyone else*: [Designers, Women, and Hostility in Open Source](http://smarterware.org/7550/designers-women-and-hostility-in-open-source).
None-coders have a notoriously hard time not just contributing, but participating at all.
You should probably just read all of Gina's posts.
And take your time, don't just say ["I get it."](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2013/06/i-get-it.html).
Seth Godin is convinced you don't.

## Writing & Reading

In his latest column, FilmCritHULK [SMASHES THE AGE OF THE CONVOLUTED BLOCKBUSTER](http://badassdigest.com/2013/06/12/film-crit-hulk-smash-the-age-of-the-convoluted-blockbuster/):

> HULK ASKS YOU A SIMPLE QUESTION REGARDING THIS: WHAT’S THE CEILING ON THESE KINDS OF EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCES? WHY DIVORCE THE EMOTION OF THE MOMENT BY TURNING IT INTO REFERENCE?

The essence of a whole generation growing up on The Internet.

FilmCritHULK also reminds us how crucial clarity is in story telling.
For example, when Shakespeare says that "Brevity is the soul of wit," he means it with all his heart as he regularly introduces the core-conflict of a drama in the introduction of the characters - just like Hulk says [The Raid](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1899353/) does.
I'm starting to think we should follow FilmCritHULK's advise in *programming*: Form should follow Function.
We should employ the most effective patterns to tell a story with great clarity.

Btw, could someone read [The Monsters that crashed the Prom](http://io9.com/concept-art-writing-prompt-the-monsters-that-crashed-t-513586914) and tell me what the core-conflict here is or the pattern used.
