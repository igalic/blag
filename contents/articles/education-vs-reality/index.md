# Education vs Reality

[Sir Ken Robinson](http://www.sirkenrobinson.com "Sir Ken Robinson")'s TED Talk [schools kill creativity](http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html "Ken Robinson says schools kill creativity") has set some thought in motion which I'd like to capture.

The educational systems dictate a fear of failure.
In my experience this stems from a falsely wired connectedness  to the physical world.Let me give you an example.
In education we are told: "If you slip and fall the lion will catch and eat you." In the real world we say: "RUN!" I can only assume this is rooted in the fact that most teachers are not practitioners of their art.

The core issue with this malpractice is that it stops people right in their tracks - even if just for a split second.
Many this will prevent completely from even *trying* to do what is necessary to save their lives, so great is their fear of the consequences of potential failure.

(Most of) education is on the wrong path - and I've felt that it is since I was 7.
I *knew* it since I was 17, but it would take another five years until I would admit to myself that this path was wrong for me and that I would no longer walk it.

Ever since I was a boy I wanted it done right.
I always taught my fellow students or juniors in school, my colleagues at work.
I was always someone to learn the hard way.
I pick up a subject, look at it from all angles, take it apart, put it back together and then look again - from all angles.
It didn't matter if it was a language, a toy car, a branch of a physics, a network protocol, a piece of software or a novel.

Even though I did have some excellent teachers, that didn't have any influence on me becoming a failure in the education system's narrow view.
These great teachers, they were actually "just" great mentors: They guided me through experiences and encouraged me to make my own.
Education isn't Rocket science, so lets close with an example from that discipline:

Nobody builds a new rocket by the textbook - but they don't build it without the textbooks either.
*They* - that's important.
Such projects aren't carried out by a single individual.
Nobody will shoot a fully manned, newly developed rocket into space.
They build smaller samples and put dummies in to see how or if it works out.

This illustrates two things:

- An embrace of failure for the sake of learning

And, almost more importantly, because none of us is an Über Mensch

- An acceptance of our individual vulnerability for the sake of collaboration

These things are exactly what makes us tiny insignificant specks in this universe so strong.
So human.
