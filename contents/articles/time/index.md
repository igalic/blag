Dear $Recruiter,

thank you very much for taking the time to send me this email.
Note however, I would have appreciated it a lot more, if you
had also taken the time to read through my profile.

<span class="more"/>

Studying my profile would have informed you that, while I'm very
skilled in some areas you are looking for, I am unwilling to exchange
my skills for any of the baggage your offers come attatched with:

* permanent (*I'm looking for a project based*)
* full-time (*max 30h/week*)
* employment (*contracting gig*)
* in a different city, usually Berlin (*in/around Vienna, or remote*.)
* or worse: The USA (*I live in a socialist Utopia*.)
* free monthly drinks on our roof terrace (*Did you know, [I'm an alcoholic?](/articles/opensource-burnout/)*)

Thank you very much for your time, but I will have to decline your offer.

Igor
