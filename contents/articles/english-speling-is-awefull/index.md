# English speling is awefull

Of the three languages I speak two have a phonetic script.
In fact the revolution of the Serbian language was inspired by German.
Even [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vuk_Stefanović_Karadžić#Quotes "Vuk Stefanović Karadžić") knows the essence of Serbian spelling:

> Write as you speak and read as it is written.

In recent years, that is during my school time, German has gone through a spelling reform, making it even easier to write by, for instance, "germanizing" foreign words.

While English is the language I find easiest to form a coherent thought in, with no coherence in its spelling it's the most difficult to write.

Perhaps not only difficult, but dangerous.
A typo can mean you're expressing a different thought.
Or, alternatively it can [expose you to trolls](https://twitter.com/#!/hirojin/status/85333388180987904 "@hirojin most things in..").

Many might argue that in this day and age a spelling reform has been rendered unnecessary with the dawn of text processors - and even browsers - with spell checking.
A lot of my writing, however, happens on pen&paper.
They are by far more patient, forgiving and a lot less distracting than a computer and [The](http://slashdot.org/ "Slashdot") [In](http://www.facebook.com/ "Facebook")[ter](https://twitter.com/ "Twitter")[ne](http://imgur.com/gallery "The Imgur Gallery")[t](http://www.4chan.org/ "4chan: Don't go there.").
Often I'll do my writing on the train, on a field or a pla(i)n(e), in my bed or someone else's and only much later will I then do a transcript.

Mistakes happen.
I'm just wondering if there's a way to direct the energy people put into complaining or trolling into something useful, like a spelling reform.
