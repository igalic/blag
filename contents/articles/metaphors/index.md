# Metaphors

Last time I sat down to write about my transformation into this person:

![me](/igor/at/oscon)

Having come once again full circle, or close to it, today I'd like to look at the changes that have happened since and talk about words and phrases which best describe them.
The first of which is

## Transformation

or *metamorphosis* to stick with the theme, has, in my mind two phases: A long phase of incubation, and a short period over which a(n often radical) change occurs.
In my case these two phases were always visible to the external world in the form of (facial) hair.
At the end of a brooding, having in my mind become a different person, or rather, having become a little bit more the person that I feel I am, I would look into the mirror, often for a long time, and, unable to recognize myself in there, I would shave until I could.[^1]

## Catching My Breath

Over the past months and years I've been in such a hurry, so much that I often would forget to even breath.
I'm taking things slow these days, doing them at my pace - and I no longer consider myself a workaholic.
And since, almost accidentally giving up on smoking, my actual breathing got better too.

You'll notice that the things I write about today are rather basic… One of these basics I have recently learned was to literally

## Chew my Food

As a direct consequence of taking things slowly, and because I realized that for quite some time now no one has *denied* me food, or tried to take it away from me, or force-fed me.
Since I moved away from "home" I was responsible for my own food, and yet I hardly ever took the time to enjoy the often elaborate things I was cooking.
Still conditioned to sling it down as fast as possible.
My body couldn't keep up with that: Hardly any of that would stick.
Just like when taking things slow in life you're much more likely to process them easier (and more properly), when you eat slowly and *chew* your food it's much easier for your body to digest it properly.
The effect of this was so immediate and dramatic, it felt unreal: I got heaps of energy instead of feeling either hungry or tired all day.

I wish I could say that I'd

## Return to Boring Regularity

but the truth of the matter is that I never had such a thing as regularity.
If you don't have certainty over the supposed pillars of your life as a kid, you don't really learn to plan, or to embrace regularity.
Not even even over the most basic things of life like sleep or food.
And who needs sleep anyway, when tomorrow at 4 you will be woken and dragged through a war-zone that everyone still calls home.

But I've started to to embrace this boring regularity in order to keep my sanity, and with it I started

## Shedding Weight

Now, some people carry their weight around their waists, I always carried it on my shoulders.
Often not just *my* weight.
As a result, my shoulders were always tense, my back hunched and my head sunk as I had gotten so used to be pressed down, held small.
I took it for granted and wasn't very surprised when I developed severe back problems.
My doctors repeatedly told me to do physical exercises, but I neglected those: When you're used to something and accept it as normal, any attempt to flee from it seems futile.
Only after I was able to shake the weight that pressed me down *mentally*, was I able to relax my shoulders, *see the light* and start on exercises that would help me with my posture and my back problems.

## Standing on my feet

for the first time in almost three decades, I was able to stand on my own feet and breath freely.
I got more ambitious: Slowly, again for

> In der Ruhe liegt die Kraft

I found my balance and tired my steps and after not quite a week I was able to walk.
A slow, proud, steady and powerful walk.
No more

## Tip-Toeing around

for there are no longer any sleeping dragons I could wake.
No more tip-toeing also meant no one could (encouragingly) step on my toes - for I had finally learned to walk.

There's not much left for me to do anymore to become the person I deem worthy to be: The kind of grown-up I would have looked up twenty years ago.

## Collecting my Thoughts

as I tend to do in the form of these writings has always been a first step to

## Finding my Voice

This time around however I must do it with a determination like never before.
I need to reach out to the people who I know care for me and enter a dialogue about a subject that is anything but easy.

There are two people in my life who I owe a lot to.
For starters, my life.
They have fed me, sometimes force fed me, sometimes starved me, most of the time emotionally.
Four years later they'd start doing similar things to my brother and I'd try to prevent it by offering myself as sacrifice.
When such a sacrifice was not accepted, all I could do was bury my head in a fluffy pillow so I couldn't hear his frantic screams.

> Brother - Brother! Why don't you help me

## Poisonous People

> All happy families are alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.

My family definitely falls into the latter category, although they tried for years and decades to pretend otherwise.
And that, right there is essentially what makes them bad people: My parents are liars, while demanding honesty for anyone else.
They are horrifically afraid of anyone bad mouthing them, when they themselves spread the most foul of gossip about friends, neighbours and kin.
The only value that they see in a thing or a person is that which can be measured in money.
My father is the kind of choleric alcoholic I urgently stopped myself from becoming.
He constantly puts my mother down verbally[^2] while she's constantly bickering at him.
My parents have unspoken expectations towards the world and everyone on it, that by their very nature can only ever be disappointed.
Conditioned by such constant disappointment they have deep trust issues.
They still don't trust my brother to be an adult, so they feed him, and wash him, and give him money he "happily" uses to poison himself.
They use their influence over him to *justify* intruding on his privacy and they use their distrust to justify why they won't leave him alone

> He might commit a crime He might hurt himself

but these arguments fall flat, become almost laughable when contrasted with those of my father:

> He deserves to be put in jail A good beating would help him come to his senses.

My parents don't trust my brother to grow up, just like they didn't trust me to make it as far as I have.
Six years ago, when I had the opportunity to

## Break the Cycle

I took it and moved away from that house.
Ever since I have slowly become a very different person.
A personality built from experiences, not from Teenage Rage.
I'm queer where they are homo- and transphobic.
I'm an agnostic skeptic feminist free thinker where they are religiously indoctrinated.
And, I'm a self-employed.
Yet sometimes I feel I might have done it all out of fear.
Fear of becoming just like them.
This fear is near visceral and I get it every time I notice a phrase or behaviour that I've copied from them.
A pinch to someone's knee, a casual put down that is answered with a dishonest laugh.
They send me into silence and into fear and into thinking, but I also think every morning when the door to our apartment falls shut behind my girlfriend: Have I said or done anything to upset her?

In any other world I would have disassociated myself from such people.
Not because their opinions differ from mine, but because they are *bad people*.
Yet, some how, because they are my parents, I'm supposed to tolerate that? No, that's not the reason.
The foundation here was not so much indoctrinated principle, but rather implanted or inherited distrust.

Just like it's hard for me to trust anyone, even myself with the world *love* for I have heard from my parents that

> Only we can love you this much

Just like I have heard from them

> We have brought you in this world, we can take you away to the next too.

As such I never trusted my parents to act like grown-ups should I abandon the family.
I believed that my mother would hurt herself, that my father may turn violent, perhaps against her.
But I decided I must break this

## Vicious Cycle

and trust my parents to be the enlightened adults they always pretend to be.
I will trust them to leave me alone and never call me, visit me or expect that from me.
I will

## Lead by Example

not so my brother can follow me into my footsteps, for I hope he makes his own way.
