# Is that a Threat?

When a little over two years ago people from the Apache community hinted I might get commit that was my reaction.
"Is that a threat?"

With the power of commit comes responsibility.
With the openness of open source comes embarrassment.
My very first commit was followed by a mail on the list.
A fellow developer pointed out to me that maybe I might want to run validations first, before committing.

Well, that was embarrassing.

Since then I've committed a lot of documentation, and a lot of code.
I've also done my fair share of reverts on those.
But that's what a VCS is there for.
You fuck up, you fix it.
Greater hackers than myself have made bigger mistakes.

Recently one of the projects I participate in has voted to lax the VCS authorization policy.
Prior to this there were many awkward levels and groups, lots of separation.

Again, a VCS allows us to revert a commit, if someone makes a mistake or a faux pas.

I'm glad we went that way.
It opens up more possibilities for existing committers.
When we add new people to the documentation team, they are now free to become developers.

One step less to take.
Make the process easier.

I'd like to invite everyone who **uses** open source to **participate** in it.

Found a typo in the documentation? Submit a patch.
That's the easiest thing in the world.

Do you use the software in a way that is not yet covered by the test suite? Write a test case.

Don't be afraid if a developer approaches you.
Commit rights are a recognition of your work and a welcome to the community.
Don't see it as a burden.
Tackle only the things you're ready for.

It's also a great opportunity to grow.
