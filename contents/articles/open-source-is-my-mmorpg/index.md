# Open Source is my MMORPG

I don't play computer games.
The last two games I finished where Seiken Densetsu 2 and 3, about three or four years ago.
I lack the talent it takes to play computer games.
How much so might become clear when I say that I've never managed to get much further than level 3 in Super Mario.
I'll not even talk about the disaster that was Pacman in my hands.

Still it is very true that I do play something.
You have to play.
You have to have a valve.
You have something that balances you out.
You have to have fun!

My sport is Open Source.

Back then when I started, I didn't play it as MMORPG, though.
It was just an RPG - I didn't have an Internet connection at home.
My only contact with the subject was through school.
When writing my programs for the lessons, I would put a license header on top - even though no one would ever see them.
I didn't care about these details back then.

With a lots of begging my parents were pursued to purchase a broad-band Internet connection.
Back then, yes I am that young, you didn't realistically have the choice of ISDN or a modem.
Other being slow, their price was also almost equal to that of a broad-band connection.
And by broad-band I mean 512/72 Kbps.
I was a newb.
And that's how I behaved.

Took a while to write, and to read.
I'm glad we stopped doing that.

Some a day, six or so years ago, two friends approached me: "You know Linux, right?" - "Yeeaah..?" - "We need an admin."

That dialogue marked the beginning.
A week later I was a regular in `#apache` on FreeNode, where I learned my ropes.

That was the beginning of the MMORPG.
Leveling for a year or two, until I could answer most of the questions.
And when I thought I had found my way around just fine, I was invited to the become Op in `#apache`.
That was an amazing experience! Other than just tinkering on other people's problems with web-servers, I felt like I could do more.
It inspired me to keep going and search for new ways to contribute.
I started supplying a couple of patches to the documentation, and bitch about it.
Until people got fed up with me and offered me commit.

I remember my first commit.
It was pretty embarrassing.
I forgot to validate the XML.
And yet, by now I'm involved in a second project documentation project at Apache: That of the Apache Traffic Server.
ATS is a weird place.
Although it's an old project that came in through the [Incubator](http://incubator.apache.org/ "Apache Incubator") it *feels* fresh.
[zwoop](http://www.ogre.com/ "Leif Hedstrom") makes it an enormously welcoming place.
So welcoming, in fact that I'm on the [PMC](http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html "Project Management Committee").

So what's the next level? From what I can tell so far, that would be an LARP.
In Open Source terms that would be some kind of conference, where the [knights sit at a round table](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/apache-knights-at-round-tables/7716 "Apache knights at round tables").
Then again, I'm very glad that [Zoe](http://zoomsplatter.blogspot.com/ "zoe's blog") has a [different take on on this](http://zoomsplatter.blogspot.com/2010/11/igor-have-you-watered-brains-today-igor.html "zoe's blog: Igor - have you watered the brains today, Igor?").
(To answer Zoe's question: No, I have not.
I don't think I've watered my cactus in months.
I hope it's well.)

Throughout the last couple of months I've learned a lot.
Good experiences have motivated and inspired me, while [bad experiences](http://blog.nerdchic.net/archives/418/) have made me question everything I thought I knew about people.
And still I'm somehow optimistic.
I'm glad that I know all these people.
I'm glad I'm part of this movement.
I'm glad it's become more than just a valve.
More than just a game.
