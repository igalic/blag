# On Stereotypes
While I'm in the middle of things I'd like to write down my thoughts, for one of those things is self-awareness.

A couple of circumstances have changed recently, and I'd like to use today's short breather to reflect upon them: Next week is the Tuesday of Carnival, and my birthday.

I've also had a lot of time to think (before getting a job, that is, now I have to think fast), most of that time I used to think about myself. Not because I'm so much of a narcissist, but because I'm so confused about the world around me -- because I'm so confused about the world within me.

Or, was: One of the biggest questions I've managed to answer for myself is who I am and what I am. Back when I was just a young lad such questions were easily answered: I was able to put myself in one of three categories at any time: Geek, Nerd, Freak. (sometimes two or all three!)

Isn't it ironic? For someone who would reject commercial labels to a point that I cut them off of jeans and shoes, I was only too eager to market and perpetuate stereotypes by readily accepting social labels.

When you wake up and stare into the mirror and from the void looking back you no longer can tell who you are looking at or why you woke up to begin with, you're starting to feel that a label - come it in form of a flashy shirt, a nice hat or a readily fitable stereotype - won't really help you identify yourself.

To be honest, that's just one reason. The other one was that I never could fully identify with a single stereotype. Despite what the pervasive media presence wants me to believe, I didn't grow up in a suburban town in America, and I didn't attend one of their high-schools either. I wasn't a classic geek. Sure I was a bright kid, at times, I had good marks, when I cared about a subject, but that's about it. I was good at sports. Despite my smoking habit (the cigarette I'm holding in my mouth right now isn't lighted, but it helps me think) I'm still a fine athlete. When you don't expect me to actually score any goals, I'm a useful team player in football and basketball. Despite my build, I can defend myself in various martial arts and crush your soul and bones on a Rugby field (I have to honestly admit that last time I played flag-football, I had the reverse experience. But then again, I played against professionals from the Viennese Women Flag Football League). Yet I wasn't a jock. I don't know anyone who is a jock. Maybe that's an American thing, I don't know - it's not my thing.

It wasn't until I met THE INTERNET that I was overwhelmed with the amount of geeks and nerds that exist. I was fascinated by this sub-culture. Sub-culture or Counter-culture. Never culture. That's important to note. Anyone considering themselves a proud minority wouldn't want to consider themselves part of the brainless masses of zombies that flow down the mainstream. No! We're different, we're special!

Despite all the openness that geeks claim for themselves there is the constant notion of: If you're not in, you're out. There is no easy guide through this culture - you don't get a patient person at the museum explaining you the difference between Picasso's pink and blue period, you don't get nice dude in saggy pants telling you NOT to start with the high ramp when you can't even stand on your skateboard. No, you just stumble into the pit and people look down on you because you don't know how to get enough XP to to get on the next level, and because you're not spending 48h a week playing, you're unworthy of being in our raid, or even being spoken to, and ugh, is that soap I'm smelling? Go away luser!

So there is that, and it's off putting. I might spend my Friday nights porting software to operating systems no one in their right mind would use anyway, but when you're having trouble with that exact thing, I don't feel entitled to rub it under your nose.

Which leads me back to what I am: I am truly passionate about the things I do, and I'm proud of doing what I can do. Especially since I started working as freelancer, I no longer feel a cog in a big machinery. I feel like a worthy cog in a machinery.

I've had to admit to myself time and time again, that the labels I've put on myself are simply not true: I'm *not* bad with people. I've successfully done the political dance and still brought on the technical change I wanted to see.

The biggest change that I feel has happened is that I no longer feel the need to argue on the internet about the futile: If someone feels the need to insult me over my principles or the editor I use, I can ignore that. If someone feels the need to be a piece of shit to someone else about their knowledge of a programming language or their preferred choice in Unix editors, I call them out on their shit.

Be a geek, nerd or freak all the way, just don't be a troll.

That being said, I'm going to a carnival party tonight, dressed up as Geeknerdfreak.
