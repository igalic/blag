# The Captain

> George, I'm sorry to contact you so early, but this is not about what you think - or hope? It's about a case. I need your help, or rather I need The Captain's help and I need your help to contact him. Please..

The Captain was an elusive character, tall and thin and dark, long arms and strong hands.
His tiny black curls loomed like the shadow of a crown in a certain light.

He closed his eyes because he was too far away from calmness that actually seeing what kind of shit was going down would have broken the last restraints.
At this point it wasn't even anger.
He couldn't get angry about it anymore.
And yet, it hurt, and he was glad to be alone in his office right now..

He looked over to the pad.
It had the same book loaded up that he still hadn't finished in the last four months.
"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea." He tabbed over to the control panel to find out how far down they really were.

The Ursus Majora was a nuclear submarine of a simple and sturdy build.
Rather than actually using its nuclear reactor to propel the ship through the sea, the crew much preferred to use the currents of the oceans to travel from satellite point to satellite point.
The Captain had been a pirate for the better half of his life but he knew the courses of these satellites much better than he knew the shifting sea currents, for he had helped put them up there and on their course in a life not too long gone when he was the leader of an oil rig and still known as Hook.

The Captain's crew was equally elusive and professional as their captain was.
This ride had, of twelve members only two amateurs, Katharina and Christopher, who'd pick up their studies in the next haven they'd drop them off, and, maybe, next spring join them, or another ship.

Thinking of the people most close to him calmed him down enough that the tears had dried up before they had a chance to shed.

He tried to focus, If, rationally, he thought about it, he couldn't bring himself to hat Peter.
He couldn't be angry with him, because, deep down he knew, whatever Peter was doing, he did, because he felt it was the right thing to do.
Yet, The Captain couldn't help but feel left down.

"If only I had...", he caught himself thinking.
If only I had known him three - no two years ago - and then he stopped right there.
He couldn't change the past, that much he knew.

He had some impact on the present and that's what he tried to concentrate on: That tiny speck of hope he and the people who shared his dream had: The hope to change the future.

24 knots/h, moving eastward, 3 hours until they hit the crossroads, or 4 hours until they hit the coast.

Soon he'd have to decide, and he didn't like the outlook.
He didn't like the idea of another person's faith to be the center of his decisions.
He didn't like the idea of any person's faith be the center of decisions.
He like simple, unselfish ideas.
Ideas reaching out and touching everyone.

"I'm getting too old for this shit." - He almost had to restrain himself saying those thought out aloud - even if he knew the chain of thoughts was inevitable: *He* had to deal with Peter.

"East it is," he thought.
"Face it," he said.

He felt heavy as he got up.
Not the wrong kind of heavy, just the heavy kind.
But he knew damn well this is the kind of news you deliver in person to your crew.
This is the kind of decision you give your crew a chance to back out from.
Are they still with you on *this* course?

As he walked down to the bridge, as the doors to his quarters closed down with a soft swish, he thought who'd be with him.
He discounted Julian, and maybe Anita.
They both had family, even if Juan's kids were older.
He thought about Hannah, Ahmed and Xi Jian - they had some background with Home - or Home-like agencies - but then, so had he...

He held his hopes up high for Juan, Lana and Mehmed - they were engineers, hackers and artists - they'd run with anything - or so he hoped.

He slowed down as he approached the door to the bridge and asked himself...
Only Ahmed and Gregory were older than him - not much, mind you.
But if *he*, The Captain, was ten years younger, like Katharina or Christopher, would he follow down this road?

No, he probably wouldn't - but the fuck it mattered? Now is Now.
Not yesterday, not five or ten years ago.
Now was the time to act, to change the future.

He stepped through the door as it opened, and while walking towards the captain's chair, he acknowledged ever greeting with a slight nod.
Once seated, First Lieutenant Ahmed bowed down, awaiting the captain's orders.

"Bourbon.
No, make it double.
Assemble the crew, please." Gently, he spoke in his ear.
The Lieutenant nodded, and as silently as he had appeared, he vanished.

The Captain waited...

The Captain looked down on his control panel and smiled a smile long unseen.
Then he took another sip from his bourbon, put it down on his CP and stood tall and proud and ready.

"Thank You, First Lieutenant," and they nodded and bowed to each other and Ahmed felt The captain's uneasiness.

"The Captain," he said, bowing to the new comers.
"The Captain Hook,", he said, bowing to his oldest crew members.

"The Captain," he repeated, to no one but himself, "is no Captain Ahab."

"His Enemy is not a metaphor.
His Enemy is not his enemy alone.
His Enemy is not The Zeitgeist.
His Enemy is real."

"This is *not* a war.
We're fighting *one* battle.
But there's another battle going on and *we* have to decide.
Because *our* decision will count in its outcome."

He stepped back, took a sip from the bourbon and started anew.

"I wish this was as simple as black and white," he said, while looking at every single member of his crew.

"Do you want to support Peter? Do you want to support the Pirates? Do you want to fuck-it-all, and do something entirely different? I don't mind."

"Two hours from now, we'll hit Honolulu Ï€.
Three hours from now, we'll hit Agamodo Xi.
Four hours from now, we'll hit Seattle Town."

"What I want is your decisions.
Where you wanna get off?"

"That is all," he said, taking his seat and nodding to First Lieutenant Ahmed, who'd come back to him, bowing and waiting The Captain's instructions.

On the seventeenth of March, at 0300 morning, a crew of twelve landed in S.
Haven, soon to be joined by a thirteenth.
