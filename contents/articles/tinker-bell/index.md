# Tinker Bell
"Do Androids dream of electric sheep?"

Oh she hated waking up with that sentence on her mind. Sleep drunk she tried to shake away the thought by actually trying to remember what she had dreamed of. Philip K. Dick however, while appearing only occasionally, remained persistent enough to bring her doubt to her very foundation. Tinker Bell tried to tell herself that it was only a side effect of transferring into a new body. She tried to convince herself that, while it wasn't very well researched, it was very well known. She tried calming herself by recalling, almost word by word, the white papers that all said it would pass once the patient had gotten used to their new condition. She buzzed and flapped her wings and felt terribly inadequate. She would have sighed, if this body had allowed for it. She would have put her hand on her face if in this body it wouldn't look ridiculous and ineffective. With her options so reduced she instead focused on her mission.

It's been two days now and her leads were few and weak. She needed to come up with a plan and it'd better be a good plan. She buzzed and took off for the ceiling. No matter how weird it might have seemed to her only a couple of days ago, right now it helped her think. Searching for patters she looked at the data she had collected, but none of it was outstanding give the case at hand: All around Town Central kids were disappearing. Most of them were left by their parents to their own devices/and or into drugs. Some Jokers had dubbed the case *The Lost Boys*, others looked for a *Door to Narnia*. It made her feel sick in her stomach. Figure of speech. If anything this body was resistant against all kinds of shit. Literally speaking.

Buzzing. There was a buzzing that ripped her from her thoughts and she was painfully aware it wasn't her. This family didn't have flies. She wasn't even sure if they liked them. How big is the chance this was another agent? What if it's a counter agent? She didn't dare flying but slowly inched over to the light where she wouldn't be seen but could see everything herself. Meanwhile she evaluated her options: Phone Home and get caught exposing herself via wifi. At least Home wasn't going to think she's crazy paranoid. The reason their agents stayed well and alive was precisely because they were crazy paranoid.

She put her wifi on passive and scanned the usual channels. Then the unusual ones. Nothing. Was it just a stray? "Fuck the sheep," she thought and took off for the window. Outside the drizzle kept keeping on like it was a contest. It was the reason she had sought shelter in the first place. It was the reason she had discovered this family with three kids. Sometimes she thought the rain was the driving force in this city.

Momentarily her thinking apparatus kicked into high gear and she ran down the protocol: The "counter agent" was a stray. It happens. If she were in a human body she wouldn't think that everyone she meets is out to get her, now would she? Yeah actually she would.

Focus. Where are the kids? She was out for twenty minutes max. This body didn't need much sleep - but just in case she waited until the boys themselves were fast asleep. But just now when she scanned the other fly there was one thing really sticking out like a sore thumb: Nothing. No wifi tags of the boys' pads. No RFID of their pids. No elevated CO2 from their breathing or heat from their bodies. They were gone.

This was getting interesting. She thought as she flew out into the night and into the ever persistent rain.

Call Home. Request search for RFIDs and wifi tags. It'll be a matter of seconds until the call was processed. Hours until the approval arrived but with Home's resources just a minute until they were found. Ending in another dead lead with abandoned pads somewhere down the haven, along with a pair of bloody RFID cutouts.

There was no time to wait for approval. Her fellow agents on the case could help by scanning their surroundings but it would be pure chance if they caught a glimpse of the boys before they became lost. Despite this world growing into a global village this was a *huge* town and her colleagues were few. She sent the call anyway. Not because she was desperate, but because it was the right thing to do. Maybe it would make up for what she was about to do, what she'd need to do sooner or later anyway: Real detective work. And that meant calling for people and AIs who operated outside of Home's self-imposed restrictions and laws.

The rain grew heavier. Heavy enough to actually make out drops. Thick long lines of water that gave off a clash when they hit the street. Tinker Bell sped up her flight dodging the drops. She genuinely enjoyed herself.

"I think it's starting now," she thought while deciding how to contact the Captain.
