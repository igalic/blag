# Mozart

I am not a Mozart fan.
Never the less I really wanted to see an Opera, and Don Giovanni seemed like a good opportunity.
I just came back from it, so here's a fresh write-up about it.

The bad stuff: Some of it was my own fault - I didn't buy tickets.
The show was sold out two weeks ago, so we had two hours of queing up to get a standing place.
With the hooligans of the Opera it seems.
And the view was, at a rough estimate, about one fourth of the stage.

The good stuff: The show was amazing.
The orchestra and the characters performed marvelously! Even though the main character, or rather his role, isn't your loveable guy - the rest of the cast was!

Don Giovanni is **very** *mozarty* and feels like an inaccurate and slightly over(?) exaggerated auto-biography.

I'm still no Mozart fan.
But I'll definately come back to another Opera.
