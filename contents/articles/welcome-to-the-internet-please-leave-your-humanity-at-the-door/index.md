# Welcome to The Internet. Please leave your humanity at the door.

Yesterday I wrote [a small list of technical things that really bug me about this Internet](/2012/06/17/things-websites-need-to-stop-doing.markdown).

## we all love listicles

As promised, today I would like to address the other, non-technical issues.
I'd like to start with something that neatly combines *three* misconceptions.

### This is a free Internet and I have the right to speak

First off, no, this Internet is not free.
In no sense of the word. We have to fight arduous battles to keep its freedom from the grip of corporations and governments.

Secondly, it's not *cost-free*, which brings me to the next way this statement is blatantly ignorant:
It's not your right to speak, it's your undeserved privilege.
Unless every last child in India, China and Africa gets their free iPhone with free Internet access the second they are born, it will *remain* your privilege and not your right.

Thirdly, even if it was your right, not your privilege, to speak your mind, it's not my duty to listen to you.
Especially not when

### Hurling Insults is considered A-Okay

As an experiment, I would like you to get off the computer, leave the safety of your apartment and walk over to your neighbour.
Knock on their door, and start an argument about that stupid doormat of theirs you never liked.
Should they get defensive, start heaping insults on them.
When they shut the door on you, keep banging on that stupid door, and, keep insulting them.
When the police comes to detain you, insist that it's YOUR RIGHT to express yourself, because this is a FREE COUNTRY.

See, this behaviour is not tolerated in real life.
So little, in fact, there are laws against it. - And this is exactly why we don't worry about the rare individual that behaves this way - we have a (mostly) functioning apparatus to contain them.

What's actually worrying are not those few individuals who express their urgent need to be complete pisswads in real life, but their staggering number of virtual counterparts, who, apparently, are never to be contained.

It tells a lot of us as humans, if this is how we express ourselves to each other *without* being forced into constraints of laws.

That being said, if you really think this kind of day-to-day behaviour is okay on blog, then FUCK YOU, you slimy waste of human space.

But you know what, it's totally okay, because…

### It's just text

Most often followed by the condescending: "so get over yourself."

And you know what, I would totally agree.
If, and only if, our culture wasn't built on text.

It's not like we've been in this kind of business when 20 years ago someone thought SMS would make a neat use of the poor GSM bandwidth.
No, we've been in this business since 5000 years ago someone thought it'd be a pretty rad idea to store their laws and other musings engraved on stone tables.

Our culture is steeped in text, and it's passed on in text.
It's hard to get over yourself, because it's just text, when something so thoughtfully put together as a sonnet by Shakespeare can cause your emotions to stir, then someone's ignorantly scrambled hate-speech has a chance to do the same.

We have come to accept that it's not just text, but that it's words, with meaning attached to them - and whether it's said by real or imaginary people, it's still *people*, with emotion and that's something we can *empathize* with.

It is exactly this human capacity for empathy that makes us protective of the people we like when they are under attack.
On The Internet this is strangely exaggerated by the lack of any real distance and time-zones, and so it becomes

### You don't like my toys so I'll fucking kill you.

Whenever someone criticises a piece of work, for whatsoever reason, the fandom bands together and lashes out against the critic.

[![Something Awful](http://www.somethingpositive.net/arch/nobabies.gif)](http://www.somethingpositive.net/sp08312004.shtml)

(Some critics know how to deal with this…)

Now I know what you'll say, criticizing something is *easy*.
Except, it's not.
Building a well researched critique, formulating it in a way that will put the work in context and point out its flaws and its strengths so they will be understood is a lot of work. In a way it's a creative process of sorts, even though it's very different from the original creators' efforts.
For instance: Criticizing a fairly low-budget movie, like "Attack the Block" is a lot cheaper than producing it (\$9 Million).

By contrast, what's really easy is unilaterally dismissing every kind of critique against one's person, against one's likes, and, yes, even against one's most favourite creator.
Even if that creator is Joss Whedon.

And by "unilaterally dismissing", I mean of course death threats, and rape threats.
But that's totally okay, because…

### I don't mean it (that way)

If you don't mean it, don't say it. If you don't mean it *that* way, then say it the way you mean it.

Perhaps, next time, we should all take those extra few seconds and consider if what we're parroting is what we really mean.
And if it's really what we mean, what would it be like to proclaim it on the street?

I can almost hear the shouts, "But The Internet is the Medium of The Oppressed! Are you trying to take that away?!"

No, because there's a huge difference between being oppressed by one's government and driving down in the wrong direction of a one-way-street in your bulldozer of ignorance.

## What to do?

Internet trolls are like bullies in real life - even if some of them might have been bullied themselves, this does not excuse their behaviour.

"Don't feed the trolls," was a nice advise 10 or 15 years ago on mostly technical forums.
These days however, when we're discussing all kinds of nuanced or charged issues on The Internet it just doesn't work.

The trolls are sometimes hard to pick out, especially when the community is shouty to begin with: We don't always get to build a community the way we'd like it to be.
We just join it, or stumble in.

The best thing that courageous people can do is transform a community by calling out trolls for what they are.
The most effective way to do that, has been proven to mail or call their employer if they are really stupid enough to troll from their work place or using their work-email.
This goes to show a troll that their actions have real consequences in real life.

What you yourself can do is simple: Consider the novel concept of treating your peers like real human beings, with real lives and with real emotions.
