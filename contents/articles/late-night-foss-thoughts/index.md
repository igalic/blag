open source has been stressing me out recently. or rather: it's been unable to
provide a counter-weight to balance my other two jobs.

<span class="more"></span>

and the reason is, of course, that it's a huge amount of *work* (at times).
work that for various reasons no one pays me (one of them being that i don't
want to be paid by a company to primarily serve their interest, rather than a
broader community's; the other that i don't really have interest in working on
a piece of software i don't use myself to solve interesting problems).

one of the main stress factors is communication. in all of its forms.
the always-on twitter. the easily-offended irc. the woefully-neglected mailing
list. the night-before-prepared talks at meetups and conferences. the
awfully-out-of-date documentation. the well-meaning-but-probably-wrong blog
posts.

i probably have a word or two to say on each of those subjects, but I'll restrict it to two:

I've become increasingly convinced lately that the Github generation is quite
uncomfortable with mailing-lists. Github issues are an inadequate replace for a
number of reasons:

* except when stated otherwise, they only invite technical discussion
* that statement, if it exists, is a link, rather than being displayed inline
* if they are disabled, my first line of communication is cut off and I'm left
  to go looking for your jira, or IRC, or twitter

i can't quite grasp the "why". why is the Github generation so uncomfortable
with properly using mailing lists? and how have we not been able to invent
something to replace them?

I'd also like to talk about talking: 

there are some wonderful speakers out there. I'm probably not one of them. but
I'm really good at convincing myself otherwise, or thinking that with enough
practice i could become better. the latter would probably even be true, were it
not for hubris: most speakers prepare their talk the night before, so I'll do
too. but it's actually only a small part of the problem. the bigger issue is
time. learning a new concept to a level that I'm able to teach it to someone in
40 minutes is hard. and takes surprisingly many times longer than 40 minutes.
("wait," you say: "why don't you just speak on subjects that you already know
about?" because, what good would that be to me?)

finally, i'd like to share some slightly more coherent [thoughts on the
subject](https://medium.com/message/how-i-explained-heartbleed-to-my-therapist-4c1dbcbe1099)
by [Meredith L Patterson](https://twitter.com/maradydd) (thoughts i should
probably share with my therapist, too.)
