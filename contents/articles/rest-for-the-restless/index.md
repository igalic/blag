# Rest for the Restless

Looking through these posts, I stumbled over a draft from over a year ago.
With my last travel fresh in mind, I find it somehow fitting.
Even though I might have thought it incomplete then, it very well describes how I feel about traveling.
So I'll just put it here:

I am relaxed.
I am indeed.

After a week of flying, walking riding on buses and trains, running after tickets or hotels.
From Vienna to London to Zagreb via Budapest by plane, to Pula by bus to Rovinj by car.
Back to Zagreb by bus and to Budapest by train.
Back to Vienna by car.

I got to know a couple of interesting people along the way.
Passers-by, single-serving friends.
I have seen many interesting, curious, disgusting and perfectly normal things.

I've read two books, and once I ran out of reading material, I started writing down my thoughts.
Getting to know myself a bit.

Since I was a child of two or three, I've been traveling.
Home soon became an abstract image, when my parents moved us kids to Austria: Everytime we went to Vienna, we said we're going home to Vienna, and every time we went to Banja Luka we'd say we're going home to Banja Luka.

When I grew older I perfected living out of my rucksack.
And now I feel most relaxed when on the road.
And once arrived, I like to discover a place.
Prying out it's hidden secrets.

I like the small stories much better than the big lies.
