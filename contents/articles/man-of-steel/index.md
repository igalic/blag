# Man of Steel

Ever since watching [Bill's monologue about Superman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFSAbxfLBYU) in Kill Bill 2, I'm even more obsessed with Superman than I was as kid.

Last week Man of Steel debuted and after reading a couple of reviews I'm even more reluctant to watching it than after seeing the first trailers.

The first bit I read on this were by io9: <http://io9.com/man-of-steel-worth-it-just-for-the-super-powered-comba-513338058> picturing the movie as great "implementation" of comic book visuals, but ultimately boring in story and character moments.
Devin Farci' first take was more in-depth at the over-the-top violence and [Superman's not caring](http://badassdigest.com/2013/06/10/man-of-steel-movie-review/).
The Movie Bob has two pieces: A [kinda meh review](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/escape-to-the-movies/7521-Man-of-Steel).
It's only in [the big picture](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/the-big-picture/7541-Man-of-Tomorrow) that I learn <span style="color: #FFFFFF"> ***Superman. Kills. Zod.***</span> ☹

In his second take Devin Farci tries to reiterate why the [destruction and violence matter](http://badassdigest.com/2013/06/15/why-the-destruction-in-man-of-steel-matters/).
He also references a former author of Superman Comics, Mark Weid: [he's heart-broken](http://thrillbent.com/blog/man-of-steel-since-you-asked/).
This picture of a great super-hero of my childhood is not how I remember him.

I'm not the only getting more [cautious about everything Zack Snyder](http://io9.com/i-dont-want-to-see-zack-snyders-take-on-wonder-woman-514100966) puts out.
I don't think I've seen anything that was both, visually and thematically cohesive since *300*.

Why am I even writing about this?

Superman is an extremely important hero.
He's a man who can do ANYTHING.
He's so powerful he has to [restrain himself at all times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=KIWle6pVv1w).
Despite living in a world made of card-board, he always radiates with hope.
That's something that kids without power, without agency or without hope can cling to, and that's why Superman is such an important hero.
Transforming him into yet-another droopy-Batman-type just because all super-heroes need to grow up and become brooding is crucially missing the point of not one, but two heroes here: Batman represents the power to *buy* your life.
Kids don't just flock away from Superman to Batman because they become teenagers.
They do because they realize that, maybe, with some cash on their hands, they can regain power, control, agency.
(Also, revenge)
Some kids never get there.

A vastly successful movie like this one, has — like always — the potential to transform the genre.
Because studios like to make money, they'll stick with what makes money.
More crucially in this case however, it has the potential to transform Superman himself.
I'm just not sure that's a good idea.
It could rob a whole generation of a hero.
