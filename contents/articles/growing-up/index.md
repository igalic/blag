# Growing Up

Six years ago a friend of mine confined to me that his (then) girlfriend was pregnant. The impossible had happened: He used a condom, she used the pill. 
Six days ago a friend of mine confined that he and his long-time wife are going to get divorced. It's hard for them. Especially because of their child.

A lot has happened between those two events. These days I'm much more reserved when dispensing relationship advise.

Two months from now I'm turning 30, so I decided it's high time I grow up. The problem with growing up though is that you never really know when you're there.
There is no ritual, or rite of passage in my culture(s) that I could have gone through. I went through military service, but military service these days is an interesting learning experience in regards to effective management, at best. At worst it's a depressing waste of six months of one's life. For me it was a mix of both.

I'm now old enough to earn my own living, support myself and my partner, and my own company. But earning money or paying taxes doesn't make you an adult. I've done that since I was 16.
Most of my time I'm doing things I genuinely like. Does that disqualify me again? Making me either child-like or as though I was retired already? I sure hope it's a myth that you have to spend your "best years" doing things you hate.

Finally there is the subject of children, one that despite my parents' best efforts for the past 15 years, I have so far avoided. It helped that all my partners so far had similar reservations. However, I have a hypothesis.

Children *magnify* and *intensify* every one of our fears and faults and the faults of our partners. If in those years that your partner and you lived together you haven't managed to overcome those fears, fix your faults, or learn how to manage them or live with them, then you probably shouldn't have children. Or perhaps not together.

This may sound cynical, but I'm speaking from lived experience: I'm still young enough to remember how growing up in a broken home feels like. I know very well how it affected me and my friends. By no means am I implying that you cannot [grow out of it](http://ashow.zefrank.com/episodes/122). It will however take time and energy and money that will go into drugs and/or therapy along the way.

I have out-grown most of my fears, and learned how to live with, or fix my faults. Yet, I don't think that children are the "right" way for me to celbrate my adulthood.

There's still two more months to find something more appropriate... but one thing I know for sure: [When I grow up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je-CPZRwbh8), I want to be someone I would be proud of.
