A friend died last night.
I write these words after the first gush of tears has stopped.

<span class="more"></span>

He said his good-bye to most of his friends at a dinner party.
An unusual good-bye.

> I love you all.

Three hours later he jumped in front of a train.

I've talked to two people on the phone since I got the message.
One of them couldn't believe it. One of them couldn't help him.

We asked each other if we have someone to hug, and ensured each other that we're not alone, and we cried, and we cried again.

I cry, because *he* was alone.
Despite all the people at that party, despite all those close friends.

And I cry because I fear he won't be the last.
I can't think of a single person in my circle of close friends who has a functional family, or who is *not* mentally ill.

I cry because I can so vividly imagine what he went through.
And I cry because I can also imagine what he went through in those three hours.

In loving memory of a dear friend, I just wish to say:

> Don't let depression lie to you.
>
> You are not alone.
>
> We love you.
