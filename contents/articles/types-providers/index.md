this is a write-up of my poorly prepared and poorly presented [talk at
puppetconf 2014](http://sched.co/1kR57MI)

<span class="more"></span>

you can find the slides of this talk on
[my speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/igalic/absolute-beginners-guide-to-puppet-through-types),
and the [video of the talk](https://puppetlabs.com/presentations/absolute-beginners-guide-puppet-through-types-igor-gali-brainsware-og)
on the puppetconf page.

initially, no, long before that, the title of my talk was meant to be:

# Complete Beginners' Guide to Puppet - Through Types!

the idea was to teach complete beginners puppet, by showing them how it works
from the very inside. types and providers are a natural start: they allow you
to define your own resources, and after all, puppet is *all* about managing
***resources***.

during the course of my research, however, i realized that this might be a
little bit naÃ¯ve. working through puppet internals is daunting, at best.

# Guide to Puppet - Through Types!

as such, i decided to keep it short and sweet, AND: by the sheer luck of having
gotten to know the authors of [Puppet Types &
Providers](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026860.do), and being
[friends](https://twitter.com/bkero) with one of the [new Pro
Puppet](http://www.apress.com/9781430260400) i also had 6 types & providers
books, and 2 pro puppet book to give out (as distractions), to anyone who asked
or answered smart or silly questions.

this is a more detailed write-up of my talk, and assumes you are
***not*** a complete beginner, that you have gone through
[puppet learning vm](http://puppetlabs.com/download-learning-vm),
and know [how to compose (good) modules](https://puppetlabs.com/presentations/practical-guide-modules-lauren-rother-puppet-labs-morgan-haskel-puppet-labs),
maybe you've even looked at the
[types](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/custom_types.html) and
[providers](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/provider_development.html)
documentation, (and came away very confused), or even read the excellent and
very short book on Types and Providers (and came away ecstatic!).

## how i got here

(ðŸš— âœˆ ðŸš… ðŸš¶)


i learned c, c++, (pic and ibm 360) assembler, java, pl/i at school. i taught
myself x86 assembler, php, ruby, and started doing linux semi-professionally.
first job was what today we call "reliability engineer", deploy/debug jee apps
on jboss running on solaris. we had automation. a self-grown solution written
in java (for unix), and i wrote the underlying deployment scripts in bash.

early on i've been involved with open source: i'm an Apache Member, a comitter
to httpd, Traffic Server. my next job was automation: and i used everything at
my disposal to automate myself away: bash, make, ruby, perl finally: i got a
client that exclusively worked with puppet, and got into that, and ansible.

but really, the way i got here is by being curious about how things work.

like most of us, i like building things, or taking things apart, and maybe
even, putting them back together.[<a id="ref_1" href="#fn_1">1</a>]

## why this talk exists

the main reason why i like taking things apart, is so i can better understand them.

![Designer's Conceptual Model vs User's Conceptual Model vs System Image](./designers-concept-vs-users-concept.png)

the above image is a book i recommend everyone to read: the design of everyday
things[<a id="ref_2" href="#fn_2">2</a>]. if you ever had trouble opening a
door, or if you ever ran into a glass door, you will find in its author, Dan
Norman, a soul mate.

but what this image in particular expresses is the tension between a system as
it appears, between how a user sees it, and how the designer envisioned it.
the more successful the inventor is in communicating their idea *through* the
product itself, the more successful the product can become.

a good example for such a successful design would beâ€¦

but for some reason, with software, that's not quite so easy.

i think we're failing Dijkstra, for the worst possible of reasons

> Dijkstra (1984) On the nature of Computing Science (EWD896) http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD896.html

let's try to make a first step towards fixing that: by extending our understanding.


# not quite oop

in most object oriented programming languages, *classes are cookie cutters, and
objects are specific cookies*[<a id="ref_3" href="#fn_3">3</a>] that result
from them.
in puppet, however a class nothing more than a glorified container. a namespace.
a way of organizing, and parametrising resources

it is also a starting point for a module. in that sense, this code,

```puppet
include ssh
```

should be all that is needed to install, configure and run openssh on a given
server. and thanks to hiera, we can move all that nasty parametrasation

```puppet
class { 'ssh':
    permit_root_login => false,
}
```

out into nicely readable yaml

```yaml
---
ssh::permit_root_login: false
```

with that we're back to where we started,

```puppet
include ssh
```

classes as containers, organising "things". those things areâ€¦

# resources

i've said a few times now that puppet is all about managing resources. puppet's
[RAL](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/learning/ral.html) is a great way to
*discover* those resources and play around with them.

resources can be humans,

```console
igalic@levix ~ % puppet resource user igalic
user { 'igalic':
  ensure  => 'present',
  comment => 'Igor GaliÄ‡,,,',
  gid     => '1000',
  groups  => ['adm', 'cdrom', 'sudo', 'dip', 'plugdev', 'lpadmin', 'sambashare', 'libvirtd', 'docker'],
  home    => '/home/igalic',
  shell   => '/bin/zsh',
  uid     => '1000',
}
igalic@levix ~ %
```

they can be software,

```console
igalic@levix ~ % puppet resource package
...
package { 'zlib1g-dev':
  ensure => '1:1.2.8.dfsg-1ubuntu1',
}
package { 'zope.interface':
  ensure => '4.0.5',
}
package { 'zsh':
  ensure => '5.0.2-3ubuntu6',
}
package { 'zsh-common':
  ensure => '5.0.2-3ubuntu6',
}
igalic@levix ~ %
```

we could use the RAL to manage mounts,

```console
levix# puppet resource mount /boot/efi ensure=mounted
Notice: /Mount[/boot/efi]/ensure: ensure changed 'unmounted' to 'mounted'
Notice: /Mount[/boot/efi]: Triggered 'refresh' from 1 events
mount { '/boot/efi':
  ensure => 'mounted',
  dump   => '0',
  pass   => '0',
  target => '/etc/fstab',
}
levix# puppet resource mount /boot/efi
mount { '/boot/efi':
  ensure  => 'mounted',
  device  => 'UUID=8235-524A',
  dump    => '0',
  fstype  => 'vfat',
  options => 'defaults',
  pass    => '0',
  target  => '/etc/fstab',
}
levix#
```

or any other ***tangible details*** of a computer's configuration.  things that
are intangible, unquantifiable, or extremely hard to discover can still be
managed through puppet but we won't (or shouldn't) provide access to them
through the RAL:

```console
igalic@levix ~ % puppet resource file
Error: Could not run: Listing all file instances is not supported.  Please specify a file or directory, e.g. puppet resource file /etc
1 igalic@levix ~ %
```


## differences

puppet's [defined types](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/learning/definedtypes.html)
try to be as close as possible to native types, yet there are a number
of differences.

knowing those differences, is what let's us answer the question, "why bother?"

* native types give access to the RAL

as we have already seen above, access to the RAL can be extremely valuable. but
it's also valuable during development: with only few lines of code we are
already able to test-drive our code on the very machine we are developing it
(if applicable ;)

* native types execute on the client-node

usually, [functions](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/custom_functions.html)
called from within the puppet DSL [execute on the master](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/custom_functions.html#gotchas). this
can have surprising effects, as we'll see in our second example. executing, and
more importantly, being able to process the output on the spot, lets us write
more powerful, and sometimes, more concise code.

* overloading $name

sometimes we want to override a
[`name`](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_resources.html#namenamevar)
to fill more than one variable, in those cases, defined types will give us a
much easier time.

# Defined Type: trafficserver::config::records

let's take a look at a defined type from the very [first module i
published](https://github.com/Brainsware/puppet-trafficserver). this module
manages [Apache Traffic Server](https://trafficserver.apache.org/). the
following type manages one of its main configuration files,
[records.config](https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/latest/reference/configuration/records.config.en.html).

```puppet
define trafficserver::config::records (
  $changes = [ $title ],
) {
  include 'trafficserver'

  $configfile = "${::trafficserver::sysconfdir}/records.config"

  $lens    = 'Trafficserver_records.lns'
  $context = "/files${configfile}"
  $incl    = $configfile

  augeas { "${lens}_${title}":
    lens    => $lens,
    context => $context,
    incl    => $incl,
    changes => $changes,
    notify  => Exec[trafficserver-config-reload],
  }
}
```

there is one key issue here: the `$changes` variable directly expects you give
it an [`augeas`](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/augeas.html) string (or
array). this is *bad design*, because the change is now opaque, and expresses
*no domain knowledge*. someone who only knows traffic server, but doesn't know
puppet **and** augeas, won't have an easy time actually making any *changes*.

## a simple type

our re-implementation as type & provider should address both concerns:

```ruby
Puppet::Type.newtype(:trafficserver_record) do

  desc 'trafficserver_record is a type to manage records.config entries'

  newparam(:record, :namevar => true) do
    desc "record entry"
  end

  newproperty(:value) do
    desc "Value of this record"
  end
end
```

the two parameters are now a `record` and its `value` â€” documentation already included!

and that is ***all*** we need to declare our type. now, before we move on to
take a look at the actual **implementation** (the provider), i'd like to get in

## a word on symmetry

the above code can now be used to express something like:

```puppet
@@trafficserver_record { 'proxy.config.http.server_ports':
  value => '80:ipv4 80:ipv6',
}
```

i'm deliberately choosing an
[export](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_exported.html),
because they are generally made to be *executed* on a ***different*** node.

thus, when we export a resource, all we care about are its *parameters*, we
don't care about its implementation. in the puppet dsl, the type we implemented
above in ruby is *just* the bits between the round `()`s:

```puppet
define trafficserver_record (
  $record = $title,
  $value,
)
```

this kind of symmetry is important in design, because even if it's unrelated in
the reality of the implementation, it helps us form an understanding of the
system.

that being said, let's take a look at `trafficserver_record`'s

## implementation

for a first look, this will be a lot to swallow, so we'll just let the code
wash over, and then try to explain its parts.

```ruby
Puppet::Type.type(:trafficserver_record).provide(:traffic_line) do

  desc 'Manage traffic server records.config entries using traffic_line command'

  commands :traffic_line => 'traffic_line'

  mk_resource_methods

  ConfigPattern = 'proxy.(config|local|cluster).*'

  # this method is only called when value isn't insync?
  def value=(value)
    @property_hash[:value] = value

    options = []
    options << '-s' << @property_hash[:record]
    options << '-v' << value
    traffic_line(options)
  end

  # get all records.config entries at the beginning
  def self.instances
    records = traffic_line('-m', ConfigPattern)
    records.split("\n").collect do |line|
      name, value = line.split(' ', 2)
      # and initialize @property_hash
      new( :name   => name,
           :record => name,
           :value  => value.to_s)
    end
  end

  def self.prefetch(resources)
    instances.each do |prov|
      if resource = resources[prov.name]
        resource.provider = prov
      end
    end
  end
end
```

[![Calming Manatee says: Just take deep breaths, it's all right](http://calmingmanatee.com/img/manatee2.jpg)](http://calmingmanatee.com/2)

as you can maybe guess from my critique above, that the previous implementation
that used `augeas` was too opaque, and not domain specific, we now go in a
different direction: apache traffic server has a command-line tool to
manipulate records.config. that tool is
[`traffic_line`](http://trafficserver.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/commands/traffic_line.en.html),
and we declare it in our
[`commands`](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/3.latest/developer/Puppet/Provider.html#commands-class_method):

```ruby
  commands :traffic_line => 'traffic_line'
```

this command will also help us implement our type & provider's access to the
RAL! by implementing the
[`self.instances`](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/3.latest/developer/Puppet/Provider.html#instances-class_method)
and the
[`self.prefetch`](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/3.latest/developer/Puppet/Provider.html#prefetch-class_method)
methods:


```ruby
  ConfigPattern = 'proxy.(config|local|cluster).*'

  # get all records.config entries at the beginning
  def self.instances
    records = traffic_line('-m', ConfigPattern)
```

here, we use the constant `ConfigPattern` to call [`traffic_line
-m`](http://trafficserver.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/commands/traffic_line.en.html#cmdoption-traffic_line-m).
this should get us all record<->value pairs that we can manipulate in traffic
server.

```ruby
    records.split("\n").collect do |line|
      name, value = line.split(' ', 2)
      # and initialize @property_hash
      new( :name   => name,
           :record => name,
           :value  => value.to_s)
    end
  end
```

`self.instances` populates the
[`@property_hash`](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/developer/Puppet/Provider.html),
all we have to fill it, is return the contents.
in our case we'll have to make sure to return both `:name` (the ever
present default `namevar`), and `:record` (our actual `namevar`).


```ruby
  def self.prefetch(resources)
    instances.each do |prov|
      if resource = resources[prov.name]
        resource.provider = prov
      end
    end
  end
```

finally, we override the `self.prefetch`[<a id="ref_4" href="#fn_4">4</a>]
method to assign each resource which carries our provider's name to be
managed by our provider, and we should now (almost) have a functioning
RAL interface. all that's missing is being able to assign the
`record`/`value` we declared in our type, with the ones in
`@property_hash`.
we can do that with [`mk_resource_methods`](). with that in place, we can test-drive our provider on the command line!


```console
igalic@levix ~ % puppet resource trafficserver_record
trafficserver_record { 'Layout':
  value => 'configuration',
}
trafficserver_record { 'proxy.cluster.bandwidth_hit_ratio':
  value => '0.000000',
}
trafficserver_record { 'proxy.cluster.bandwidth_hit_ratio_avg_10s':
  value => '0.000000',
}
trafficserver_record { 'proxy.cluster.bandwidth_hit_ratio_int_pct':
  value => '0',
}
...
trafficserver_record { 'proxy.local.http.parent_proxy.disable_connect_tunneling':
  value => '0',
}
trafficserver_record { 'proxy.local.incoming_ip_to_bind':
  value => 'NULL',
}
trafficserver_record { 'proxy.local.log.collation_mode':
  value => '0',
}
trafficserver_record { 'proxy.local.outgoing_ip_to_bind':
  value => 'NULL',
}
```

the only thing missing now, is to ***set*** the `value`. we'll do this, by
overriding the `mk_resource_methods` generated `value=` method:

```ruby
  # this method is only called when value isn't insync?
  def value=(value)
    @property_hash[:value] = value

    options = []
    options << '-s' << @property_hash[:record]
    options << '-v' << value
    traffic_line(options)
  end
```

first, we have to make sure that `@property_hash[:value]` is populated.
with that in place, we fill an `options` array, that we again pass to
`traffic_line` to set the value.

by placing the `commands` wrapped call to `traffic_line` as last expression in
our methods, we take care of all failure modes, and the return value. and with
that in place, we can now use `trafficserver_record` to set a value:

```console
igalic@levix ~ % puppet resource trafficserver_record  proxy.config.admin.autoconf_port
trafficserver_record { 'proxy.config.ssl.SSLv3':
  value => '1',
}
igalic@levix ~ % puppet resource trafficserver_record  proxy.config.ssl.SSLv3 value=0
Notice: /Trafficserver_record[proxy.config.ssl.SSLv3]/value: value changed '1' to '0'
trafficserver_record { 'proxy.config.ssl.SSLv3':
  value => '0',
}
igalic@levix ~ %
```

# intermezzo

[![baby goat](http://media-cache-cd0.pinimg.com/736x/41/3d/b5/413db593be277802ab859ff684f3ab47.jpg)](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/272678952412018812/)

before we move on to the next example, i'd just like you to look at this baby
goat. look. at. it.

# Defined Type: git::config

in our second (and last, i promise!) example, we'll take a look at those
[latter two points](#differences), and how they affect us:

* native types execute on the client-node
* overloading $name

this is the example of
[git::config](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-git/pull/32),
which i tried to replace with a type&provider. it overloads `$name` to
be usable as section.value, just like the
[git-config](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration)
cli program:

```puppet
define git::config(
  $value,
  $section  = regsubst($name, '^([^\.]+)\.([^\.]+)$','\1'),
  $key      = regsubst($name, '^([^\.]+)\.([^\.]+)$','\2'),
  $user     = 'root',
) {
  exec{"git config --global ${section}.${key} '${value}'":
    environment => inline_template('<%= "HOME=" + ENV["HOME"] %>'),
    path        => ['/usr/bin', '/bin', '/usr/local/bin'],
    user        => $user,
    unless      => "git config --global --get ${section}.${key} '${value}'",
  }
}
```

this code will work wonderfully in a [master-less
setup](http://www.jamescun.com/2012/12/14/masterless-puppet.html). it will also
work fine if any of the `$user`s that we use it for exist on the puppet master.
if they don't it will fail, simply because of the line:

```puppet
environment => inline_template('<%= "HOME=" + ENV["HOME"] %>'),
```

worst yet, it will fail silently. to mitigate this, and to make this type
(near) universal, we have to implement it as native type.

our first throw might look something like this:

```ruby
Puppet::Type.newtype(:git_config) do

  newparam(:name) do
    desc "The default namevar"
  end

  newproperty(:value) do
    desc "The config value. Example Mike Color or john.doe@example.com"
  end

  newparam(:user) do
    desc "The user for which the config will be set. Default value: root"
    defaultto "root"
  end

  newparam(:section, :namevar => true) do
    desc "The configuration section. Example: user."
  end

  newparam(:key, :namevar => true) do
    desc "The configuration key. Example: email."
  end

end
```

notice the symmetry here between the type declaration, and that of the defined type:

```puppet
define git::config(
  $value,
  $section  = regsubst($name, '^([^\.]+)\.([^\.]+)$','\1'),
  $key      = regsubst($name, '^([^\.]+)\.([^\.]+)$','\2'),
  $user     = 'root',
)
```

they both define parameters (or properties), and they assign them default
values where necessary. what's missing is parsing `section` and `key` from the
`name`. let's fix that:

## title patterns (are weird)

```ruby
  # taken from augeasproviders
  def self.title_patterns
    [
      [
        /^(([^\.]+)\.([^\.]+))$/,
        [
          [ :name ],
          [ :section ],
          [ :key ],
        ]
      ],
      [
        /(.*)/,
        [
          [ :name ],
        ]
      ]
    ]
  end
```

while this may be some of the weirdest code you've seen (today), and while,
according to its API documentation unstable/private, overriding
[`title_patterns`](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/developer/Puppet/Type.html#title_patterns-class_method)
is the cannonical way to do this. if we are (for now) stuck with it, let's at
least try to understand what it does!

expressed in words, `title_patterns` is supposed to return:

> an Array of Arrays, which are filled
>
> with a Regex (to match the title),
>
> and an Array with a symbols (optionally mapped to a proc) arrays.
>
> or else, nil.

that proc (or lambda) is just a "function", which can be used to modify the title (or the matched part). in this case, we don't actually need it, so we won't bother!

next we zoom into the regexes: we are defining two of them:

* one to match a valid expression
* the other to match all invalid expressions

if it's invalid, we just assign to `:name`, and we're done.  if,
however, we match `key.value` - we need to populate ***all*** fields.
most importantly, that also includes the default `:name`, which is what
we have the outer layer of `(regex grouping)` parens for.

# Discovering the implementation

before we move on, let's try to reflect where we stand, and how we've gotten
here: in our first type & provider pair, all we did was write a method for
`value=`, and that worked out fine, because we had a simple way of determining
*all* `record`/`value` pairs.

but here, that's not possible. there's no (simple, cheap) way for us to
find out all possible values for all `section.key` <-> `value` pairs,
for *all* `user`s. we have to find a different way of doing it: we have to override the "getter" for `value` as well:

```ruby
Puppet::Type.type(:git_config).provide(:git_config) do

  mk_resource_methods

  def value
    require 'etc'
    user    = @property_hash[:user]    = @resource[:user]
    key     = @property_hash[:key]     = @resource[:key]
    section = @property_hash[:section] = @resource[:section]
    home    = Etc.getpwnam(user)[:dir]

    current = Puppet::Util::Execution.execute(
      "git config --global --get #{section}.#{key}",
      :uid => user,
      :failonfail => false,
      :custom_environment => { 'HOME' => home }
    )
    @property_hash[:value] = current.strip
    @property_hash[:value]
  end
```

in that getter, we make sure that all the variables we need have already
been set, and if they aren't, we just do it ourselves, by filling the
holes in the `@property_hash`:

```ruby
    user    = @property_hash[:user]    = @resource[:user]
    key     = @property_hash[:key]     = @resource[:key]
    section = @property_hash[:section] = @resource[:section]
```

now comes the most crucial part. contrast:

```puppet
    environment => inline_template('<%= "HOME=" + ENV["HOME"] %>'),
```

with

```ruby
    home    = Etc.getpwnam(user)[:dir]
```

spoiler alert: only one of those will actually work.

next we emulate the `unless` clause:

```puppet
    current = Puppet::Util::Execution.execute(
      "git config --global --get #{section}.#{key}",
      :uid => user,
      :failonfail => false,
      :custom_environment => { 'HOME' => home }
    )
    @property_hash[:value] = current.strip
    @property_hash[:value]
  end
```

we find out the "current" value of `value`, by running[<a id="ref_5"
href="#fn_5">5</a>] the same git command as we did in the `exec` of
`git::config`. then we just put it in `@property_hash` and return it.
with our getter in place, puppet can now, thanks to
[`insync?`](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/developer/Puppet/Property.html#insync%3F-instance_method)
decide all by itself, if it's necessary to set `value`. to allow for
that setting, we'll override `value=` again:

```ruby
  def value=(value)
    @property_hash[:value] = value
    require 'etc'
    home = Etc.getpwnam(user)[:dir]

    Puppet::Util::Execution.execute(
      "git config --global #{section}.#{key} '#{value}'",
      :uid => user,
      :failonfail => true,
      :custom_environment => { 'HOME' => home }
    )
  end
```

we ~persist~ `value` into `@property_hash`, and then execute the same
command as above, except this time, we set `failonfail => true`.

and now we're done!

let's test it, with this manifest:

```puppet
# gmt.pp
git_config { 'merge.tool':
  user  => 'igalic',
  value => 'vimdiff',
}
```

using `puppet apply`:

```console
igalic@levix ~/src/puppet/puppetlabs-git (git)-[type] % puppet apply gmt.pp
Notice: Compiled catalog for levix in environment production in 0.02 seconds
Notice: /Stage[main]/Main/Git_config[merge.tool]/value: value changed '' to 'vimdiff3'
Notice: Finished catalog run in 0.17 seconds
puppet apply gmt.pp  9,76s user 0,90s system 99% cpu 10,731 total
igalic@levix ~/src/puppet/puppetlabs-git (git)-[type] % puppet apply gmt.pp
```

and again, to make sure it's idempotent:

```console
igalic@levix ~/src/puppet/puppetlabs-git (git)-[type] % puppet apply gmt.pp
Notice: Compiled catalog for levix in environment production in 0.02 seconds
Notice: Finished catalog run in 0.13 seconds
puppet apply gmt.pp  10,04s user 0,79s system 98% cpu 10,950 total
igalic@levix ~/src/puppet/puppetlabs-git (git)-[type] %
```

woohoo!
