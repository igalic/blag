# Writing is hard. Let's go shopping

This post is an overly long reply to a [tweet](http://twitter.com/#!/SlimSaammy/status/126810814677127168) by [@SlimSammy](http://twitter.com/#!/SlimSaammy):

Writing is hard. As a writer you pour out all your creative heart and soul, compressing it through a pen to put an idea on a yellowing piece of paper.
Or the same thing with a computer, but that doesn't sound so cool.

In any case you will be expressing your thoughts and your ideas and maybe you'll be reaching out to people.
If you're lucky, millions of fans.
If you're unlucky, millions of critics.

Everyone is a critic and I find it adorable when writers claim they themselves are their biggest critics.

Here's the point: You don't hear my voice.
You can't tell I'm saying "adorable" in a sarcastic tone.
Unlike your English teacher you also don't know me and my entire history and the fact that Charles Dickens and me find [blue curtails a depressing expression of our sad lives](http://imgur.com/gallery/QWGrU).

Not being your English teacher you also can't tell if I'm [suffering of a peanut allergy](http://www.groupon.com/groupon_says/groupon-says-47268927 "Groupon Says") myself, wishing I could get rid of it with a simple sign, or if my interpretation of gender equality is that mothers are liars and girls are a disease.

To quote an article on [gamedev.net](http://www.gamedev.net/blog/355/entry-2250790-there-are-many-kinds-of-ugly/ "There are many kinds of ugly"):

> When you produce a product that is used by a million people, a "one-in-a-million" bug means you'll have a dozen reports of it on your desk by tomorrow morning.

Writing is hard.
When reaching out to millions of people you could call it outright dangerous.
Though, I think that would give it too much credit.
