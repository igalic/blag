sometimes when i picture our dystopian apocalyptic future, i picture a world in
which workers *don't* unite.

<span class="more"></span>

i picture a world in which we continue to work, continue to work longer and
continue to earn less. and yet there won't be any rebellion because the ever
expanding work, which, paradoxically, despite all automation continues to grow,
also continues to seep into our lives.

and for the poorest of the poor earning less and less and yet being taxed the
most, the only flight is into homelessness and starvation.

and even those who know that they will be next won't have time and energy to
invest in the revolution, because they have to pay forward to survival.

and while inequality increases, capital prevails, and remains successful, at
that. for the only marker of success that capital needs is its own existence.

> it's the justification of power imbalance.

i think we're getting closer to that future by the day, as we are making all
forms of dissent harder if not impossible.
