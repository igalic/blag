# Accomplishments

I'd like to follow [@kvegh](https://twitter.com/kvegh)'s proposal and write about this past year's accomplishments.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>The world would be a better place if everyone announced and congratulated on pastyearachievements instead of newyearresolutions.</p>&mdash; Karoly Vegh (@kvegh) <a href="https://twitter.com/kvegh/statuses/415605164494422016">December 24, 2013</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Let's start with a few personal ones

* I have now lived for over a year with my partner in our apartment. Not only did we not kill each other, but we've also grown as a couple.
* I decided that I'm now grown up enough to be considered an adult and shall celebrate this achievement. I have no idea how
* for the first time I spoke at a conference, in front of 200+ people, without being nervous.

On the professional side:

* I took a deep dive into puppet, when I reemerged I had transformed [brainsware](http://brainsware.org)'s infrastructure such that not a single thing is done manually
* I read books on architecture, design and philosophy to broaden my horizon
* after learning the declarative Puppet language, I decided the best thing to do is to learn a functional programming language, so I started learning Lisp

I'll be writing about the first to points on [brainsware](http://brainsware.org/blog)'s blog.

# Fantasies

Since resolutions don't really work very well for me, I'd like to share some fantastic ideas instead. After a rather dreary year for The Internet as a medium, or as I prefer to consider it: A place, I'd like to see some wrongs righted.

Information Technology in general and The Internet in particular are very young fields, it's not too late to fix it. Even if that means to rebuild it [from the ground up](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tschofenig-hourglass-00) in some cases.

I'd like the The Internet to be a safe place. [Safe for Anarchy](http://cluborlov.blogspot.co.at/2012/05/making-internet-safe-for-anarchy.html)

One of the principal drivers for both, the tracking that so easily enables the Government Agencies, and the money machine for companies small and big, are ads. I'd like to find a way for (small) companies to earn their living in that strange place, The New Internet we re-invent this year, that is the metaphorical anti-thesis of ads --- perhaps going so far as being "physically" incompatible.

What'd you think?
