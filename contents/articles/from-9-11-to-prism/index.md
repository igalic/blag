# From 9/11 to PRISM

WARNING: This is going to be a ranty round-about across several fields.

Let's start with this at what most would consider its beginning: September 11th, 2001.
I was at the sports field with my school and my teacher called us all and told us and he told us to "remember this," and how we'll "never forget it" and I thought it was a joke.
At this point I thought it was a farce.
The fact everyone was making such a huge deal out this.
This being a country which has deeply embedded in [struggles of its own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre) was so busy repeatedly invading, bombing and collateral-damaging other countries[^1].
Yet everyone was acting surprised when there's a counter-attack?
To no one's surprise, out of this genuine surprise, that someone would attack the greatest nation under the sun and the pinnacle of freedom and democracy, was born paranoia and overreaction.
For the first week air-traffic was shut down, and then security was increased, or rather, [security theater](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/01/in_praise_of_se.html) was.
Does anyone remember flying before 2001? Maybe it was my young impressionable age, but I genuinely enjoyed the feeling before the flight and the fact that I'm sitting in a chair 10,000 m above the ground moving almost at the speed of sound.
Now it's just a drag[^2].

Fast forward 12 years and we'll see where paranoia and security theatre on one hand and technological advances in the field of [putting boxes on web-pages](http://www.aeonmagazine.com/living-together/james-somers-web-developer-money/) has brought us.

We've had [data collection programs](http://theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/06/what-we-dont-know-about-spying-on-citizens-scarier-than-what-we-know/276607/) for as long as there we have generated data, but it was always rather clumsy because it had to be centralized.
These days it's no longer necessary to collect data centrally.
A security agency can just go to those who already collect data, and being an agency associated with the government and with questionable powers given to it *by* that government it can simply demand this Data.
Data that sometimes accumulates accidentally, but more often for its own purposes.
We've had scandals for as long as we've had politics and big corporations, but the scale at which this is currently happening is more than telling about the underlying political and corporal structures.

What we have right now is a combination of elements that is unprecedented.
We have hundreds of big and millions of small corporation, hardly any of which create anything genuine themselves.
The value and reason to use these services comes from their users.
As such these corporations are all in the business of selling advertisement so they can make any money, and given how big and successful they are, one could argue that they are really good at this.
They are really good at this because they collect and analyse all the data that we type into their services.
They use that to deliver us targeted advertisement based on our search queries, tweets and Facebook posts, our üëça  our ‚òÜs.
And of course our private messages and our private emails.
Having such enormous collections of data lends itself to a number of things, and the first that comes into the mind of the security-minded IT geeks is abuse, or worse: accidents.
The former, albeit surely not titled *ab*use, our governments have realized can be really practical to track down criminals and terrorists.
Time and again we have been warned that knowledge is power and concentrating such power in the hands of government is a slippery slope no matter how democratic said government tries to paint itself[^3].

The leaks, as well as the accidents of the past couple of years have had the effect that they kept service providers in check, or that they put certain laws under review.
I'd also like to imagine that slowly, with every new leak, the trust in governments and corporations by their customers and citizens was eroding.
I also like to imagine riding on a Unicorn, and Operating Systems and Programming languages everyone can agree on, because they don't suck.

The leaks, be they accidental or the diligent work or whistle-blowers or security aficionados, have shown us how vulnerable we can be.
The InfoSec community, or most IT geeks in general, have been lamenting over this for years: I for myself have never shared on Facebook or Twitter anything that I wouldn't share publicly everywhere else.
Here's a [random, publicly archived, email I sent this month](https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/trafficserver-dev/201306.mbox/%3C600346073.37063.1370268394230.JavaMail.root%40brainsware.org%3E): it has my full name, email address *and* phone number[^4].
I made this decision consciously, to make my public persona as transparent as possibly, to leave no doubt as who I am, even if [who I am seems schizophrenic](/2011/06/09/whoami).
I doubt that all of those six million accidentally [leaked Facebook users](http://www.zdnet.com/anger-mounts-after-facebooks-shadow-profiles-leak-in-bug-7000017167/) made such a decision.

# Duality

There is a strange duality between big corporations and big nations.
They are targets for people's live and work mainly because either we grew up with/in them or because we moved there[^5].
They are target of (other) corporations, big and small, either because they offer tax breaks, brains, a good location for the founders, laziness, or a fitting target audience.
They have [so many laws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc) that are so [complex](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/98-93.ZD.html), or [Terms of Service](http://tosdr.org/) so long no and convoluted no one would read, let alone understand them.
They are taking the trust of those who have entrusted them with power, however feeble that power may be, for granted.
When this trust was breached, we've seen denial, non-apologies, apologies with money, on the side of corporations, because that's the business they are in: Saving face while making money.
On the side of governments we have seen denial, prosecution and a hardening of the same laws that have been criticized, because that's the business they are in: making laws and enforcement them.

I know how to fix these things on a small scale: in business, we vote with our money.
On The Internet we build protocols or APIs, not services.
Innovative companies try to break into niches which are *not* advertising.
On a national scale we vote with a ‚úó on a piece of paper for the party that least offends our tastes.
If the government created from those little ‚úós keeps offending our tastes, we vote with our actual voices, flooding the streets and shouting at them until they listen.
If they still don't listen, we set them on fire.

By now, it's an established cycle of life: Nations are born out of fire, they grow with fire, or cuddle together for financial or ideological reasons.
With time their administrative apparatus grows cancerous and is so corrupt that all ideology is just farce.
Once the news, or at this point: leaks of this have trickled far enough down the social hierarchies a fire ignites.

I have no idea how to fix this on the scale that we have today: modern corporations have all of this, but with a twist.
They operate on The Internet.
Theirs is the empire where the sun truly never sets.
As such they have customers with very different cultural imprint, and expectations[^6].
They also have to abide by the laws in all those countries they are servicing people.
Perversely this has lately turned into corporations servicing increasingly paranoid states' governments with the data they collect for advertisers so that these governments can hunt down terrorists.
For me this show starts to end when the government prosecutes political activists and whistle-blowers.
In Russia this has been going on for so long, it's started the next logical step: [brain](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20498711) [drain](http://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2013/02/27/the-myth-of-russias-brain-drain/).
With just 12 years of recent experience, the US is fresh to this game; Silicon Valley continues with a giants' steps to revolutionize society and government.
With innovative ads.
