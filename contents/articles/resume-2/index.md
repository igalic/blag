# Résumé

It's been a while that I posted a [résumé](/2010/02/12/resume).
Now that I'm out of job you might think that I have more of a reason to update it, but being busy starting up I was in no hurry.

I am however always on the lookout for interesting projects to work on a contracting basis.
If you wish to use my services, you can *contract me* via [office@brainsware.org](mailto:ofice@brainsware.org)

Here are some of my qualifications.

## Open Source

I have been an Apache committer since February 2010, I joined the *Apache httpd*, and shortly thereafter the *Apache Traffic Server* [PMC](http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#management "How the ASF works").
This year I became a [member](http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#asf-members "How the ASF works").

My contributions to these two projects have been mostly documentation, but also the odd code fix.
I have recently taken over the *release management* of the stable branch of Apache Traffic Server.

Outside the ASF I am active with [OpenCSW](http://www.opencsw.org/ "OpenCSW Solaris packages"), a community concerned with providing high-quality Solaris packages of open source software.

I love to travel and attending Open Source conferences is a great excuse to do so.

## Site Reliability Engineer

From 2007-2011 I have been working as "Application Engineer" with Bwin International Entertainment AG (now: bwin.party services (Austria) GmbH).
This is an operations role that roughly translates to "Site Reliability Engineer".

While mostly responsible for internal infrastructure and services such as

- Subversion
- Continuous Build and Integration
- Solaris software packaging (- right after porting said software to Solaris)
- Apache httpd, Apache Tomcat and JBoss AS customization
- centralized deployment automation

I have also actively participated in

- *on-call* duty for the entire production landscape of Unix back-end applications.
- performance bottleneck analysis of various, interacting systems

Furthermore I have *trained* colleagues new and old, showing them the ropes in everything we used, and everything useful

- Version Control
- Unix Basics and (Shell) Scripting
- Apache httpd: Configuration, customization and optimization
- JBoss AS: Configuration, deployment and trouble-shooting

## Languages

My mother tongue is Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian (take your pick).
I am fluent in German and English.
That means, I am well capable of constructing mostly intelligible sentences in written and spoken form.
If necessary, or wished for, I can hold this up long enough to fill entire presentations, or trainings, or books.

## Brainsware

Finally, a word on Brainsware: This is a three-men-enterprise with odd chemistry that just works intriguingly well.
Most of my responsibilities lie in, or around Systems Engineering:

- designing and implementing the architecture of the infrastructure
- central configuration and deployment automation
- the often neglected monitoring and backup.
- Live trouble-shooting as well as
- reproducing those troubles in test environments.
  And, finally, closing the circle with
- performance and scalability improvements

While I do stick my nose into development from time to time, I strictly stay with the back-end: This can be to hack a new feature into Apache Traffic Server that we desperately long for, or hacking on our PHP application framework or its test-suite.

## That's all folks!

Even if this list is far from complete, it would be just tedious for me to write and for you to read, anything other than the most important corner stones.
But, if you ask me, "Can you do Foo?" and I have never heard about Foo, rest assured I'll know how to do Foo five minutes/hours/days after you asked me.
