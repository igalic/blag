# Information freedom on The Internet

A couple of thoughts on SOPA and PROTECT-IP, which don't fit into a tweet.

Information on the internet **will** be free - one way or the other.

It's sad I have to say this, but I want to be very explicit about this:

Hollywood lobbyists and politicians are definitively in a stronger position today.
While they are creating and shaping the policies that will govern the future of this generation and those to come, they fail to understand who this generation is and how it works.

But it doesn't really matter.

We are younger.
We will out-live them.
We will change their politics - or we will adapt to become pirate scum.
