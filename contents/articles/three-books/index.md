# Three Books

I recently finished reading the third book within just a few days - one of which I started reading almost a year, the other, about six months ago.

So long as my memory is still fresh, I would like to write down a couple words about each.

## The Cannibals of Candyland

Carlton Mellick III's bizarro world, inspired only in name by the board game, is a strange world to begin with.
When our hero, Franklin, climbs down the rabbit hole we see the full potential of this fantasy: It does not disappoint.
I devoured this book as it pulled me in, bowed to its ideas and became intrigued by the otherworldly erotic, mixed with a very worldly portion of disgust.

If all you knew was the [book's cover](http://www.amazon.com/The-Cannibals-Candyland-Carlton-Mellick/dp/1933929855) it would be all you needed to know.
Candy people hunting for kids to eat them.

## How to Be a Woman

Caitlin Moran is a journalist.
She's also a funny and a STRIDENT FEMINIST.
She decided to pour all those things that made her into a book about how to become her.
I stumbled over this book in Heathrow, while waiting for a flight back home, waiting to kill four hours of waiting, waiting, not sleeping because I planned not to sleep so I would miss out on jet-lag.
Spoiler alert: That didn't work.

This book was extremely difficult for me to read, because I'm generally not very good with people, as I've claimed a couple of times.
Learning radical new concepts is always a little challenging.
It took me almost seven months, a time in which I decided write a book of my own, drank a lot, wrote a lot, lost my manuscript, started working again, quit writing for about three months for fear of losing anything again, and picked it up again because I found tumblr, quit writing again, because I was told I suck and started working on becoming better (this blog post is not part of that process).

What I'm actually trying to say is: I was a feminist *before* I started reading this book, but since I read it, I've become a STRIDENT FEMINIST.

I'm also looking into passing the book on to my growing nieces.

## Sedam Strahova

I found this book by Selvedin Avdić in Mostar, while traveling the Balkan last year.
The only thing going for it was its title - Seven Fears - its cover and the fact that it was written in Latin, not Cyrillic, which made it about three times easier for me to read.

It tells a story of a reporter who, nine months since his wife has left him, didn't leave the apartment, dwelling on his depression.
A friend's daughter shakes him awake by giving him her father's diary, describing his last actions - a hunt for a ghost.
Soon the man finds himself, reluctantly, helping her and going on a ghost hunt himself: For her lost father.

It's a book about disgusting egoism, destructive loneliness and the fear thereof.
The fear of death, and the inescapable madness and death during the time of war.

Even though the main character is a disgusting creep at times, and an anti-social loner most of the time, the author treats him with respect and he treats us readers with respect.
He knows that we're all afraid of being sucked up from the loneliness, of dying the death of a loner, leaving no mark in this world other than the stink of our rotting flesh next to a list of our unsatiated desires and our unfulfilled wishes.

But it's also about stumbling over a book and into a world, and, perhaps creating a new one.
