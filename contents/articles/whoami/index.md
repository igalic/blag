# whoami
If I could objectively observe myself interact in the community, I would probably find myself to be perfectly schizophrenic. Among other things.

Two or so years ago I started getting rid of all my email addresses, merging them all into one: i.galic@brainsware.org

Unfortunately, for many reasons other than schizophrenia and paranoia, that doesn't work with the rest of the Internet. This alphabetic guide to who I am where and maybe why - mainly serves me to remember which username I'm supposed to type on which site

a-hiro
======

a-hiro or ahiro is who I used to be on this blog before moveing it off WP, I have also occasionally used this as a nick on IRC.

a-hiro is derived from anti-hiro. Which can be understood as both "anti-hero" or "anti Hiro" - with Hiro being short for Hiroji (see hirojin).

I'm also [ahiro@tigris.org](http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/buglist.cgi?Submit+query=Submit+query&component=subversion&&email1=ahiro&emailtype1=exact&emailassigned_to1=1&emailreporter1=1 "ahiro@tigris.org")

CoughUpBlood
============

Yeah. Seriously. I use this as a handle on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/CoughUpBlood "YouTube: CoughUpBlood"). After trying to register for half an hour, iterating through variations of all the names on this page, I got a little frustrated. In hindsight, "cough up blood" is what I want to do when I read comments on YouTube, so it's okay.

hirojin
=======

I only registered Twitter for testing my mail server, because a customer reported issues. Meanwhile it has become my only interface to Facebook.

-   [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/hirojin "Twitter: hirojin")
-   [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/profiles/hirojin "Gravatar: hirojin")
-   [Opera](http://my.opera.com/hirojin/about/ "My Opera: Igor Galić")
-   [Tumblr](http://hirojin.tumblr.com/ "Welcome to the unimportant")

hirojin is derived from Hiroji Nagasaki. He's a character I once invented.

igalic (i.galic, igor.galic)
============================

[igalic](http://people.apache.org/~igalic/ "people.a.o: ~igalic") is my official Apache committer handle. i.galic I use as handle on [Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=i.galic "Jira: i.galic") and [Confluence](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/~i.galic "Confluence: i.galic").

On Launchpad I'm [i.galic](https://launchpad.net/~i.galic "Igor Galić in Launchpad") too.

You can find me as [igalic](https://sourceforge.net/users/igalic "SF: igalic") also on SourceForge/OpenCSW, as well as on [GitHub](https://github.com/igalic "igalic (Igor Galić").

[igor.galic](https://www.facebook.com/igor.galic "Facebook") is my Facebook handle.

Incidentally, this is derived from my name!

Although there have been exceptions in the past, on IRC I'm known as `jMCg`. Two notable exceptions include opposite day `JmcG` and a phase where I went as my alter ego `a-hiro`. When acting in official (Apache related functions), I'll usually `/nick igalic`. n.b.: I have a `/hilight` on all of these and many more.

I also use this handle on the [httpd wiki](http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/jmcg "Httpd Wiki: jmcg") and on [Fedora Hosted](https://fedorahosted.org/logrotate/query?reporter=jmcg "Fedora Hosted: jmcg").

jMCg on ICQ: 140807021

In some places it'll be 'jaymcg' and when I stumble upon them I should put them here so I remember...

... like: Skype

jMCg is derived from John McGregor. Another character I once invented.

Malcolm Earnest Smith
=====================

Malcolm Earnest Smith, and any variation of the name such as: malsmith, mesmith, malesmith, etc.. This is yet another character I once invented and who for a long time only existed in my head or in silly stories I wrote. I used this handle for creating a Gmail account to access the Android Market, that means there's a:

[malcolmearnestsmith@gmail.com](mailto:malcolmearnestsmith@gmail.com "malcolmearnestsmith@gmail.com")

where you can send me mails I'll never read.
