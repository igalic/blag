# Things websites need to stop doing

This is my list of pet-peeves on the internet that need to stop.
Mind you all of those are technical - not social, that will be a topic for another day ;)

## 5: Stupid, stupid, STUPID restrictions on passwords

This was so annoying, I have dedicated a website to the topic: [Catphrase](http://catphrase.org/)

If I'm bored another Sunday, I might start going down for the other items on this list…

## 4: Your password form does not allow my browser to remember the password

Do you really believe that your site is so important that I have to remember it, and the random string of crap I had to choose based upon your stupid password restrictions instead of having my browser remember it? Yes? You must be delusional. Next.

## 3: Please repeat your Email address

I have almost learned to accept this UX/UI anti-pattern after watching people actually use their computer:
Besides wide-spread inability to type (correctly) without looking down on the keyboard, hardly anyone anyone knows about the magic of `Ctrl+C`/`Ctrl+V` - because this will forever be what I will do when your site forces upon me to re-type my email address.
Right after a sigh of annoyance.

## 2: International Company running a website for International Customers can't spell my name

My name is "Igor Galić", it's *not* "Igor GaliÄ‡", or "Igor Gali¿" or "Igor Gali?".
Usually I will find new creative spellings only *after* the sign-up, when I receive the first email.
Granted, it's easier to get this wrong in emails, but also easier to fix.

The bigger offenders are those who refuse to accept anything but the 26 letters of the English alphabet as input to begin with.
Given how not even English fits in the 26 letters of the English alphabet, I consider that approach to be naïve at best.

Here's a nice post by Patrick McKenzie, who's name some system already reject: [Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/ "Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names")

## 1: Your Website is so horrible, even people who can't see it think it's horrible

Sometimes I don't have access to anything but a text-browser such as [elinks](http://elinks.or.cz/), [lynx](http://lynx.isc.org/) or [w3m](http://w3m.sourceforge.net/).

Now, you might not know this, but if, for a second, we ignored cat pictures and porn, then the internet would be pretty much just a bunch of text.

Should be pretty easy to navigate with a text-browser then, right?

Wrong. There's a staggering number of (big, important, money-generating) websites that are completely unusable in these browsers.
It also means they are mostly inaccessible to people who cannot see (very well), and have to rely on text-browsers/screen-readers/Braille-displays.

# What to do?

If someone has directed you to this blog post, it's probably because they think your website fits one or more of the listed criteria.
Please help make the internet a better place and fix your website.
