# The End of an Era

So I was bored.
That's how these things usually start ;)

I hooked up one of my external hard-drives via an USB Connector.
This is one of those 3.5" drives, so it needs extra power supply.

It felt strange, that the green led of said power supply started glowing even before I had plugged it into the power outlet.
Then I looked over to my laptop, and noticed it's gone blank.
Not only that, but also dreadfully silent.
And it smelled of burning silicon.

Once I had everything unplugged again, and verified that, yes, this smell's coming from the laptop, I tried to turn it on again.

Nothing.
Dead Silence.

In vain hope I could see and maybe even repair the damage, I started taking it apart, but getting out the disks, the battery and the RAM is how far I got without breaking anything.

So now it's sitting on my coffee table, exposed inside out.
(I shall add explicit images, as soon as the film is developed)

Now, after seven years of trust-worthy service, Laptorix is dead.
It will be missed, but only shortly.
I need a replace.
Soon.
