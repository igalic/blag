Open source is work. Not just a work of passion, but real actual work. And it
can be taxing. I'd like to discuss how.

# Why I'm telling you this

I could be telling you this for a number of reasons: first off, I could simply
be lying. This could be a fabrication, one way or another it's a manipulation.
I could be trying to feed you sublime messages about the importance of
diversity, in order to further my feminist, queer agenda. But, actually, it's
about making myself vulnerable, about opening up. This is an extremely
sensitive subject, so I will need you to trust me.

Many of those things on this list can be "fixed", other things are not for
fixing but might need to be discovered and embraced.

I cannot go back and change the fact that as a child I had to flee my home
country, and along with other things in my history, it made me the person who I
am. I have "managed" my alcoholism in a simple, yet effective way: I quit.

This, however, is not so simple with depression, or when you're a workaholic.

# Depression

I am constantly reminded of the fact that depression is a chronic illness, one
that can drastically shorten someone's life-expectancy. Be that through the
media, medical journals, or personal experiences.

Last week, [a friend of mine died](/articles/a-friend-died-last-night/)

I have read, and re-read these words many times since the night I wrote them,
and they remain painful.

There are no words from me that can fittingly describe the overpowering feeling
of nothingness, of one's own inadequacy, and the loneliness that makes up
depression. Better artists have already done that.

All I can contribute is this

> Depression lies, and when we listen to its lies, it kills.
