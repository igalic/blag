title: Open Sourcing Mental Illness - open source burnout

This talk runs under [Ed Fink](http://funkatron.com/)'s Banner of [Open
Sourcing Mental Illness](http://funkatron.com/osmi.html), who has been running
these types of talks for over a year now. Ed talks very broadly on the subject,
while still backing it up with his personal stories.

I'd like to mirror his work under that banner: I'd like to talk about
depression, and addiction: Open source is work. Not just a work of passion, but
real actual work. And it can be taxing. I'd like to discuss how.

Content Warnings galore: The topics I discuss and the stories I tell can be
triggering. I am perfectly happy answering questions, but not everyone will
be comfortable asking. You can always seek me outside of this talk.

# Why I'm telling you this

I could be telling you this for a number of reasons: first off, I could simply
be lying. This could be a fabrication. But one way or another it *is* a
manipulation.  I could be trying to feed you subliminal messages about the
importance of diversity, in order to further my feminist, queer agenda. But,
actually, it's about making myself vulnerable, about opening up. This is an
extremely sensitive subject, so I will need you to trust me.

***This trust comes with a caveat:*** I am not a health-care specialist. All I'm
doing is sharing my own stories and experiences. What has worked for me, might
not work for you. All I can do for you is listen to your stories, but the only
real advise I'll be able to give is to ask you to seek help.

Let's get back on to my list: Many of those items can be "fixed", other things
are not for fixing but might need to be discovered and embraced.

I cannot go back and change the fact that as a child I had to flee my home
country, and along with other things in my history, it made me the person who I
am. I have "managed" my alcoholism in a simple, yet effective way: I quit.

This, however, is not so simple with depression, or when you're a workaholic.

# Depression

I am constantly reminded of the fact that depression is a chronic illness, one
that can drastically shorten someone's life-expectancy. Be that through the
media, medical journals, or personal experiences.

Last week, [a friend of mine died](/articles/a-friend-died-last-night/)

I have read, and re-read these words many times since the night I wrote them,
and they remain painful.

There are no words from me that can fittingly describe the overpowering feeling
of nothingness, of one's own inadequacy, and the loneliness that makes up
depression. Better artists have already done that.

All I can contribute is this

> Depression lies, and when we listen to its lies, it kills.
