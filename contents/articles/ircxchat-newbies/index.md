# IRC/XChat newbies
    21:20 -!- Irssi: Join to #xchat was synced in 1 secs
    21:20 < jMCg> Hello happy people.
    21:20 < jMCg> Could it be that the default configuration of Ubuntu's XChat doesn't quite distinguish between a highlight and a query?
    21:20 < nanotube> jMCg: elaborate?
    21:21 < jMCg> I've noticed a couple of people who I prefix with, say,
    21:21 < jMCg> nanotube: talking to them in a channel, and they write me back in /query -- all of those people use XChat.
    21:22 < nanotube> jMCg: er... maybe they're typing "/query jMCg blabla" and that's why it's coming in as a query?
    21:22 < nanotube> or maybe they're clicking on your username, which opens up a query
    21:22 < jMCg> nanotube: they're all newbies. I doublt that.
    21:23 < jMCg> nanotube: the latter seems more probable...
    21:23 < nanotube> jMCg: probably the latter, then
    21:23 < nanotube> yea.
    21:23 < nanotube> if they're using xchat-gnome, then it is by default configured to take single click as to open a link.

Please don't do that. [http://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc](http://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc) and others explain how you'll get actual help on IRC.
