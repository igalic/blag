over the past couple of weeks i've noticed a number of things with regard to my
use of twitter. some of it troubling, others enlightening. currently, there's
an unrelenting stream (see what i did there?) of people opining on twitter (the
company) making changes to twitter (the service). i'd like to add to this
stream with personal observations.

i signed up to twitter in may 2009, as a test of whether our mail server was
really rejecting mails from twitter, as a customer of ours had claimed. it
wasn't. but now i had a twitter account, and no idea what to do with it.

a lot of my tweets at the beginning were inner monologue, or reminders for
later (which i then promptly forgot about). i experimented for a time with
tweeting and facebooking at the same time, but at some point facebook just
turned me off, completely and i effectively quit posting there about 2½ years
ago.

facebook was mostly people i "knew", yet it felt sleazy. i didn't really feel
comfortable posting all of my thoughts on it. most importantly however,
facebook was things i *knew*. twitter was things i didn't know, and that's what
made it interesting.

i use twitter to learn things. i use it to learn *about* things i already
thought i had a pretty good understanding of. about events, about topics i
care, and about things i didn't know i would care. i *am* your twitter
feminist. twitter has shaped my [skepticism](https://twitter.com/bengoldacre).
it introduced me to [neuro](https://twitter.com/Neuro_Skeptic)
[science](https://twitter.com/neurobollocks) and
[biology](https://twitter.com/edyong209). it has helped shape the way that i
[critically think](https://twitter.com/FilmCritHULK) about
[movies](https://twitter.com/the_moviebob), or
[story telling devices in general](https://twitter.com/foldablehuman).
it's helped me understand, and, critically [own depression](https://twitter.com/CherryMakes),
retaining my humanity. i've learned about [the end of the world](https://twitter.com/Annaleen),
about [fifty shades of grey](https://twitter.com/Jenny_Trout), and about
[pronouns](https://twitter.com/ntlk). i established my feminism as
[trans feminism](https://twitter.com/nataliereed84), and cemented my philosophy as
[anti capitalist](https://twitter.com/steveklabnik). i've learned to become a
better human, allowing myself to form a
[relationship](https://twitter.com/DrNerdLove) again. and i've secretly laughed
about [horrible puns](https://twitter.com/aedison).

and i have used it to procrastinate.

so here's the thing: i work on a computer. *no one* can tell if i'm debugging
an immensely mind boggling networking issue, writing open source software, a
blog post, or a comment, or if i'm

and often times i do. when hard work needs to be done, and i don't even know
where to start, i'll stare at twitter. sometimes i'll say something smart, and
i'll get  ☆ or retweets and i'll revel in the recognition. my 1.5s of fame.

and like any other coping mechanism, if your brain learns that it works for
(against) "hard work", it sure can use it for anything else, too. leaving the
house? leaving bed? nope. one more page, one more article about
[surveillance](https://twitter.com/ioerror), or about
[activism](https://twitter.com/caulkthewagon) and then i'll sleep.

twitter can be draining. it can be especially draining when you care. early on
[a friend](https://twitter.com/noirinp) gave me [reason to care](http://blog.nerdchic.net/archives/418/)
about the [state of my industry](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_incidents).
my industry is in a shabby state. and [every woman](https://twitter.com/ashedryden)
who [points that out](https://twitter.com/shanley) is heaped with abuse and
harassment.

just watching that is draining. stepping in, most of the time ineffectual.

many people have gone on
[hiatus](https://medium.com/quinn-norton/twitter-i-love-you-but-youre-bringing-me-down-96f86c76b9d6),
or to [writeonly](http://words.steveklabnik.com/im-going-writeonly-on-twitter-for-a-while)
mode.

for now, *i'm* contemplating moderation. tomorrow,
[we can speak to one another](http://words.steveklabnik.com/im-going-writeonly-on-twitter-for-a-while)
again.
