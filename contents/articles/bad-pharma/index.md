# Bad Pharma

Last year I “discovered” Ben Goldacre.
Ben is an author of books, and a guardian column.
Speaker of (TED) talks.
He used to be a practicing doctor, but has given up on it in favour of being an epidemiologist and an activist of good and righteous things.
He is also a nerd.

I now have both of Ben’s books at home, and have only just finished his second book, [Bad Pharma](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0007350740/ref=nosim?tag=bs0b-21 "Bad Pharma on Amazon (I'm not getting paid for linking this;)").
(I haven’t started with the first one yet ;) - so while it’s still fresh in memory, I’d like to say a few things about it.

The better part of reading this books I was angry: This book tells the story how medicaments come to be.
How they are researched, dreamed up, or stumbled upon and then developed, tested and eventually brought to pharmacies, prescribed by doctors, sold to and taken by patients.

And for the most part, it’s not a pretty story.
Instead it’s a story about unpublished data, hidden and rigged trials.
One third into the book my anger had faded into the background.
I wasn’t because I had become jaded.
It wasn’t because the numbers or stories about fraud, secrecy or misguidance didn’t affect me anymore.
And it wasn’t resignation either.
It was a slowly growing resolve.

Even with health, or often times life-and-death being at stake, people like to keep a myopic view on the world.
Pride, fear and greed, or sheer ignorance as to ones impact or power will always win out against what’s moral and good.
That is, until we take a radical shift to create a social pressure to adhere to.
In a way, I’m following [Raganwald’s recent call to all hackers](http://braythwayt.com/2013/04/29/calling-all-hackers.html).
I’m joining the voices that shout that there is a *social damage* here, and I’m telling you how to fix it.

The best cure for this messy situation, as Ben himself puts it, is sunlight.
Go over to [All Trials](http://www.alltrials.net/) and (read and) sign their petition.

An equally important way of fixing it, before your government gets around to doing it, is by investing yourself: Be curious.
Ask questions.
Ask your doctors where all these shiny posters in the waiting room come from.
Or ask them if they’d ever give away your confidential data a representative from a drug company.

And if you’re like me and know a lot of people who work in the pharmaceutical industry, tell them about this book, or borrow them your copy.

Change *will* come, if we [*really* want](http://lesswrong.com/lw/f1/beware_trivial_inconveniences/) to.
