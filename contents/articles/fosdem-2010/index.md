# FOSDEM 2010
I was there, and I survived!

[Nick Kew](http://bahumbug.wordpress.com/) of Apache fame insisted that we all come to FOSDEM and I agreed, since it's in Brussels, an European City I've never been to, doesn't cost a thing! - and goes just over the weekend! In the end my managers decided to even pay for the trip!

So.. how was it you ask? Well.. Great, and not so great. I'll start with the not so great stuff:

Even if it's thousands of geeks, I still feel awkward among so many people. Every restaurant in Brussels is a tourist trap. I attended one bad talk.

Now to the really awesome stuff: There are thousands of geeks :D

There was an [amazing number of talks](http://fosdem.org/2010/schedule/days) and unfortunately I couldn't just split up and attend all of them.

So here's a summary of what I learned in no particular order:

-   The Internet is evil, but that's okay, because you can make money of it.
-   Linux and FreeBSD are really easy to hack and contribute to
-   But Minix 3 is much better anyway.
-   Scaling Facebook is amazingly easy (if you have really cool and smart people and a huge cluster running Hadoop)
-   Everybody should know (not learn, KNOW) Lua. (I already ordered [THE Book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/8590379825/lua-home-20))
-   ESB sounds like a cool solution when your Data Interface is a moving target
-   This year, CouchDB does not [perform like a pr0n star](http://www.slideshare.net/mattetti/couchdb-perform-like-a-pr0n-star), it's boooooring.

These four days I spent Brussels were really great fun -- but also terribly exhausting at the same time. I spent a lot of time with niq, chatting and developed a couple of ideas, one of which is Lua related.. Let's see what becomes of it.
