# How to hire me

In the past months I have often received emails from head-hunters, or offers from people I know who work for big companies and would like me to join them.
I have either ignored those mails, or declined these offers, mostly repeating myself. In the future, I'll just point people to this space.

I am self-employed - and I love it. I (mostly) work from home (and then without pants). I work on interesting projects, with brilliant people. If you want me to come work on your project I'm all up for it if:
 
* you have brilliant people, much smarter than me on the team I'm supposed to work with.
* it's a sensibly defined project where you need my special skills,
* or you want my brilliance/insight as consultant over a longer period of time or for training your employees
* I don't have to move (permanently) to a country which is politically much worse off then the one I live in right now (say: Ireland, the USA, or Libya)
* I can remain self-employed
* You are not Amazon, Apple, Google, Sony, etcâ€¦: I don't use your products/services[^1], and I don't want to work for you.

[^1]: I try really hard not to use your products/services, but the rest of The Internet is making it really hard :\
