over the past couple of years i've read a bachelor's degree worth of feminist
writing, as well as social and medical sciences. in the following text, i would
like to dissect my growth into the world of intersectional feminism.

# why do you keep strumming on that harp?

in particular, i'd like to answer the question i receive from eye-rolling male friends

# meritocracy and colour blindness

like most young geeks i've been [steeped in the
literature](http://modelviewculture.com/pieces/the-open-source-identity-crisis)
of Eric S. Raymond's Jargon File, and J. Random Hacker made me parrot that I'm
colourblind and made me think that equality.

i've long since suspected that there was something foul in the state of open
source, even at a time when i didn't know the word "meritocracy" yet.
funnily enough it would be women who taught it to me.

# women's tragedies

and, as always, it was a woman's tragedy that finally opened my eyes.

the tragedy of women as a background narrative, while at the same time their
stories must never to be believed:

# believing is the first step

# my feminism will be intersectional or it will be bullshit

# missteps and step backs

# calling out and calling in

# but i'm a humanist / equalist!

lol.
