# The Open Source Model
A couple of days ago I wrote a [rant on newbies on the Internet](/2010/03/20/newbies-on-the-internet-vs-other-fields), today I'll try to differentiate or deconstruct that, specifically targeted towards FOSS.

In doing a lot of support in \#httpd, I have learned patience, most of all. Over the years I've also learned a lot of FOSS. This free and/or open software doesn't cost you a dime in acquisition or in licensing. It costs you a ton in skills, though. So it's paid in time and in patience.

But there is more to it: The very moment you download a piece of FOSS and try to make that damn thing run, you have become part of a (huge?) community, and as such you are expected to make an effort. You are expected to read the documentation, you are expected to try to understand the documentation, and you are expected to report when something isn't working as it is supposed to, or when the documentation is unclear or wrong. Most welcome are those who bring a patch.

Now a word on support. All those unfriendly people with too much time on their hands lurking on IRC, or answering mailing lists, they all have yet more expectations you have to live up to. They are not your paid 24/7 support line. They are the community, just like you. Most of them got there with questions themselves, and they stayed for who knows what reason. Curiosity, the possibility to learn, the chance to help others, or just masochism. So when joining an IRC channel named \#omfzd, and asking a specific question about the TLSed SASL negotiation under authenticator deamon, you are generally expected that you already know how to use your OS, how to install and start and stop this or other daemons. If that turns out not to be the case you will be forwarded to \#yourdistrohere, where you can learn about those things.

Please make the effort. Do the steps to help people help you. And remember: You are part of the community. You too make it work.
