# Random Facts About Me

This is an assorting of random factoids random people have gotten to know about me through the magic of conversation.
They occur in no particular order.
Rules for reading: Top down.
Rules for updates: Appended at the bottom.

I'm 177.5 cm tall and weigh between 65.8 and 68.5 kg.
There was a time when I weighed between 72 and 75 kg, but that was only during my military service.

My arms are roughly the same length as those of a friend who is \~195 cm.

I eat more for breakfast than you eat the whole day.

I am *always* late.

Once I came about six hours later than planned to a friend, because I had an accident on my bike.
An ambulance behind me was the reason I looked back, and hence, steered off, sliding into the pavement at *really* high speed.
They kindly picked me up and brought me to a hospital.

Since I started growing a beard at the age of 13, the average facial surface covered in beard has only increased.
Usually in bounds, when I grew out a full beard for two month period.

Thanks to conditioning during my military service I get sick to my stomach if I don't wear a hat when outside.

I have taught myself reading (Latin) at the age of 4.
At the age of 7 I started school in Banja Luka where I learned (reading in Cyrillic and) writing (in Latin and Cyrillic).

The first time I was bored in school was after moving to Vienna, my first lesson in German.
It was a cold and almost dark outside, early in a February morning, while unbearably hot in the classroom.
Above our heads was spread the alphabet.
We spent an hour writing the 'b'.

I spent seven years in a five-year school, failing every odd year, and repeating every one, except the fifth, where I "ran out of years".
(That basically makes me a high school drop-out, except that the in Austria we learn stuff in high school that Americans only learn as undergrads)

I have trouble distinguishing between left and right.
That was a reason I failed my first practical driving exam.

I also confuse or swap numbers in my head, such as 1984 → 1948.
I blame this on my learning German.

When writing with pen/paper, I sometimes swap d/g, or just leave out entire chunks of a word or a sentence.

My parents are Christians.
My mother is catholic, my father is orthodox.
We have always celebrated *all* holidays, which are usually 2 weeks apart due to the differences in the calendar.

My brother and me are Atheists.

I stopped believing in Santa Claus when I was five and in god when I was around six.

My first time in Vienna was when I was five.
I spent almost all of those two Winter months in front of the TV.

I learned speaking German from the TV, building my vocabulary by *reading a dictionary*.
That dictionary (I still have it) also fascinated me because of the different alphabets it held (Latin, Russian Cyrillic, Greek).

I grew up travelling back and forth between Vienna and Banja Luka.
Or as we called it: Home, and Home.

The longest journey we ever had took us from Banja Luka, south, through Serbia, and back north through Hungary (War did not permit a more direct route).

It was in the deepest of Winter, the streets (we didn't take the highways) where covered in ice, the passengers had to leave the bus and hold it to keep it from sliding down a ditch.
It took us 23 hours, and it turned out the Soldier at the Serbian border was right, when he said: "Izbečićete se vi do Beča." ("Your eyes will pop out until you reach Vienna.")

In junior high school I was in an experimental class with three VERY different performance levels in the same class.
(I was in the highest).

The first time I was aware of some kind of romantic or sexual thing going through my body or mind was through the sense of smell.
I was 9 years old.

We had a very basic sort of course of English in primary school, which I attended.

I learned English from movies, online chat, and, again, by reading a dictionary.

I remember once having said: "I'll never forget this." - I remember when it was, in what context it was, who the person was I told it, but I don't remember what the person said that I promised I'd never forget.

The first beer I ever liked was Guinness.

I smoked pot long before my first cigarette.
I frequently stated the reason I smoke cigarettes at all is because it's a poor (and cheap) substitute for pot.

This was later also what I stated for beer I drank: It was a poor (and cheap, and most of all: Available) substitute for Guinness.

When I was a kid I knew the programme of a Bosnian comedian we had on cassette tape by heart.
oday I'm unable to remember (phrases from) books such to cite from them.
I also don't remember that programme anymore, so…

I once competed in an amateur decathlon for the fun of it, and with minimal preparation.
I can roughly leap my own height, jump three times of that, and do twice my height in pole-vaulting.

Thanks to a very invasive procedure I learned that that my bowels have one extra twist.
(That officially makes me a freak.
It also might explain my strange eating habits.)

My mother once saved me from drowning in a lake.
One more nail to the coffin of my rather sceptic view of star signs: I'm a "fish", but swim like an axe.
The latter has improved slightly over the past 20 years.

In an attempt to re-learn running, after ripping a ligament when drunkenly jumping over a fence, I bought a pair of *those* [shoes](http://xkcd.com/1065/).
It worked out quite well.

My last Halloween costume took about 2 weeks preparation and cost me around € 1,200.--: I was dressed as Awkward Goth Lady.
(The awkward part goes without saying, because underneath, I was still me)

A friend helped me once out by driving me in his car through the countryside of lower-Austria, slowly, with the windows down, listening in for music: We were looking for an illegal techno-festival where a friend of mine I then hadn't seen in seven years was DJing.

Absinthe is a drink I'm not allowed near to, or, shouldn't be: In a competition with a friend, I once drank four.
Afterwards I *ran on all fours* after a Taxi, *barking*.

The following countries I have, in no particular order, either visited, *lived/worked* in, (or passed through): *Germany*, *Austria*, the Czech Republic, (Slovenia), Croatia, (Serbia), *Bosnia*, Slovakia, Hungary, Italy, (Switzerland), Ireland, England, Egypt, (Wales), France, Belgium, Canada, USA, (Netherlands: They picked me out on the Airport because I seemed suspicious and thoroughly searched me, so I'm counting this!)

Hungary doesn't count as "worked in", because I haven't been paid for working on a friend's house (smashing walls, ripping up the stone-floor tiles, etc…)

But if we restrict it to paying, neither would Germany count: After three weeks of unsuccessful peddling for the "Johanniter", I had earned so little money that I went home hitchhiking.

Often on my travels I am without money, without a plan and with no map, with an empty battery in my cell-phone, no hotel booked or even the faintest idea where an affordable hotel is, nothing to eat or drink, no camera to document what I see or live through, and with a stupidly silly smile on my face.

When I was in the inside of the Pyramids, I didn't really feel awe-inspired, because those thousands year old walls that I touched felt like the hundred year old, nicotine soaked wallpapers in the [classical Viennese Café Bendl](https://bendl.wordpress.com/).

My hair has been those thick strands of dark brown ever since I was a kid, but that never bothered me, until I turned a teenager, and looks suddenly started to matter! Soon, I discovered that my hair was unmendable.
Or at least it refused to yield to my will, or a comb.

These days my hair and I have made peace.
Either that or I just stopped caring.

All the clothes I own fit into one medium-sized suitcase.

I once woke up with a bucket between my legs and had friends retell a tale of how it got there.
It wasn't pretty, but it was pretty funny.

While I was unemployed I stopped asking people what they "Do" at parties.
Not only because the of the obvious counter question, but also because the answers were generally depressing.
So many people did stuff they didn't like to do, so instead I started asking them what it is they like to do.
Even though I'm not unemployed anymore, I still prefer that as a conversation starter at parties.

I don't like to celebrate neither my birthday nor Christmas.
(I don't know what's up with my birthday, but I tell you: When you grow up celebrating Christmas twice a year, you get sick of it *waaaaaaaaaaay* sooner.)

The only times I had my beard shaved off since I was thirteen was: (Involuntarily) during my six months of military service, and (voluntarily) each year for Halloween (if it was necessary).
This also summarizes my opinion on the Austrian Military.

When I have a song stuck in my head it's often not alone, but rather [it's accompanied by two or three others](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e29k-F5jBpk).

It's never silent in my head, I have thoughts constantly racing.

A friend once gave me a Star Fleet badge as birthday present.
The gimmick would make the typical sound when touched, and I wore it unembarrassingly on my clothing, even as I went to play basketball.

Even though I can hold a basketball in one hand, and even though I can leap almost my own height, I cannot dunk.

My favourite T-shirt had a print of a modern architecture that said: *We shape the things we build, thereafter they shape us."* (When my mother decided it was too bleached out and unfitting for me to wear anymore she used it mop the floor and then threw it away.
A perfect analogy for my relationship with my parents.)

A friend and I once spent our summer holidays hacking on an micro kernel: [OCB - Operating System Concept B](https://scm.brainsware.org/svn/ocb/branches/OOCB/).

I presented the unimpressive results of our work at school (I don't know if my friend did the same at his school).

Basically we had a managed to produce an "ISO" that could be booted on virtual or real hardware from a floppy, had a very poor idea of memory management and could address the screen and write to it - IN COLOURS (my least unsuccessful attempt to producing graphical output on a computer ;)!

For this presentation I had learned LaTeX.
It turned out that having previously learned compiler theory greatly helped me figuring out LaTeX compiler errors.

Bored from what school had to offer, I learned compiler theory at the age of 17 from [Jack W. Crenshaw's Let's Build a Compiler](http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/).

The book was written for the Pascal programming language and targeted the Motorola 68000 family of computer chips.
While learning I translated it on the fly to C++ and x86.

After that I started designing my own programming language.
I stopped when I realized it was resembling my least favourite programming language: PL/I.

I still have the design documents.
The language was called 'Y', and "why" was the only ting I'd ask when looking at the results.

I am *one of six* people who work on both, the [Apache httpd](http://httpd.apache.org/) project and the [Apache Traffic Server](http://trafficserver.apache.org/).

One of my mother's brothers taught me how to play poker at the age of seven.
I don't think I ever progressed from the level.
But then again, I learned walking when I was 10 months old, and look at me still not being a marathon runner, or whatever the fuck you're supposed to become when you learn a skill at early age.

I have learned and to varying degrees of intensity practiced three martial arts: Jiu Jitsu, Aikido, Iaido.

I have never used my martial arts skills in a street fight.

When playing ball sports, I usually play defensive roles: Goalie at football and the rebound-position (on both sides;) at basket ball.

The only ball sport where I played successfully in both defence and attack position is Rugby.

I learned riding a bike when I was 12.
Been on a bike ever since.

About a year in after I had my driving license I "bought" a car from my dad.
(That is: I was chasing after the money I should've earned working a month on a de-construction site, and couldn't believe myself when I came back holding over a thousand Euros in my hand.
He took all but 100, and told me I can have his old car, he's going to buy a new one.)

I have received a number of medals and trophies competing in athletics and Jiu Jitsu but they all fell prey to my spring-cleanings.

In contrast: I still have pretty much everything I ever wrote.

With exception for a manuscript of a book: I lost it at the end of last year and consequently feared writing down anything for over three months.

I've been wearing glasses since I was 10.
I chose the dorkiest pair that health-insurance would pay and felt like Clark Kent when putting them on for the first time.

These days I wear a pair of simple metal ovals with only a bridge on the nose, no pads on the sides.

Their predecessors (which was the exact same build) I sunk, together with custom-made, detachable sun-glasses, in the Danube river at a friend's birthday party while wake-boarding.
(Well, trying to)

This my first (and so far last) attempt at wake-boarding also earned me a scar on the forehead, which, I like to imagine, was the reason I had hot steamy sex for the first time with my then not-yet-girlfriend.

I don't know if I bruise easily, since I only ever fall heavily, but I heal quickly.

When I had all my body hair (painfully) removed for last year's Halloween costume, that was the first time in ca 18 years that I'd seen my knees.

Whenever I ask someone how much sugar they want in their coffee/tea, I think of [this scene from Bugs Bunny](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKyhTX9LQEA)

The previous tenants left my current apartment without a single light bulb.

After a freak storm where my back-pack and its contents got wet, my laptop's DVD drive showed a certain aversion against all that water, spinning uncontrollably.
I ripped it out and have since then (\~2006) been without an optical drive in that computer and, by choice, *any* computer that followed it.

I (legally) own(ed) two DVDs and five music CDs, none of which I've bought myself, none of which I can watch or listen to.

Two guys *once* attempted to bully me in Jr High.
After that, no one tried that ever again.

Incidentally this was also the day I was more broadly labelled as "crazy".

A virus scanner popping up when I attempted to compile a programme for a school assignment (over ten years ago) led me to fully turn to Linux and never look back again.

The first time I had a burn out while still at school, at the age of 21.
It was essentially three months of me not leaving the bed.

A second case came after four years of work, at the beginning of last year.
It was only after it was over that I realized this has been going on for years, and I needed professional help.

I titled a blog post about my start of therapy [coming out](/2011/09/25/coming-out).
The inspiration for writing such a thing in the first place came from a friend who was [dealing with with her depression](http://blog.nerdchic.net/archives/434/) in a similar fashion.

Regarding my sexual orientation, I never really came out about that to anyone, except in casual conversaiont with my friends and they weren't really very surprised that I'm queer as fuck, because that's how I behaved all along!

(Although one of my girlfriends assumed I was gay for a period of time - before we got together.
I don't know why.)

After ripping a tendon in a basketball game in my right ankle, I wore a cast for six weeks.
I continued to play basketball with the cast, breaking it at least once a week.

I have never broken any bones, only had the ugly stuff: Ripping a tendon, ripping a ligament, epiphyseal plate irritation, ripping the cartilage in the finger knuckles.

I can never remember if it was me or my brother who had their tonsils removed.

For a long time the only visible scar on my body was that of an operation I had as kid from a inguinal hernia.
(It is no longer visible because I'm now covered in fur)

When I go for a run, I do so without head-phones, because I always have a tune in my head anyway.
But when I'm on a bike, I'm without head-phones, because of the reckless way I ride ;)

My favourite colour is blue, the most beautiful blue I have ever seen was actually the mesmerizing turquoise of the Red Sea.

8 double espressos a day were the limit for me.
The horrible shaking and the nervousness made me rethink my stance on coffee.

The fact that the coffee at work tasted like it went through a waste disposal to begin with helped a lot and I made the jump to tea.

I have walked the southern most parts of the Via Appia while in Brindisi.

One of my most favourite books is "Frühlings Erwachen" (Spring Awakening) by Frank Wedekind.
I read it twice, saw it as musical, and discovered in an Amanda Palmer music video a reference to it in her bush.

I cannot do the most basic of arithmetic in my head, I need to use pen & paper, or, you know, computers.

Whatever it was that convinced me I had gotten shots for Hepatitis A/B at the military, I learned the hard way I did not while in Egypt.
I am now Hepatitis A resistant, and meanwhile vaccinated against B.

A homeless guy ripped me off in Atlanta, taking my last cash for taking me to a taxi stand.
I was so tired, I didn't really care.

From this however I must've learned never to have cash on me, or money, for that matter… :-S When I told a beggar in Sarajevo that without money I'm much happier, and most importantly, free of worry, she looked at me like I was [stark](/igor/is/stark "stark") [raving](/igor/is/raving "raving") [mad](/igor/is/mad "mad"), and wished me luck in life.

At the beginning of this year (orthodox Christmas day, to be precise) I took the [The Last Man Standing "challenge"](http://tse.lastmanstanding.at/2012/) with a friend, riding from the Vienna Prater to Bratislava.

While working at the Vienna Airport, I regularly rode the \~18 km home by bike, taking about as long as I would by public transport.

That was a slight improvement on the public transport there: While working in the city I would only take half the time by bike.

I've had every single passport that could've been available for me during that time, until I acquired the Austrian Citizenship: Yugoslavian, Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian (briefly, only, and almost illegally).

I once taught a first class in my school (secondary college for Information Technology) in programming.
It was a pretty tough experience, because, well… teenagers.
But it had me well prepared for when, about some six years later I taught colleagues at work, all of which where older than me: They behaved the exact same.

* * * * *

As a kid I kept staring at walls until I could see through them.

* * * * *

I grew up in an [abusive household, and wrote about it](/2012/07/26/there-and-back-again-stockholm "There and back again: Stockholm.") during a trip to the USA.
Someone said it reminded him of Dostoyevski, but [The Internet claims otherwise](http://iwl.me/b/2b568272 "I write like…").

Whenever I write "The Internet", which I always capitalize, I think of: [4chan/b](http://boards.4chan.org/b/)

In a sort of competition with colleagues, I once ate a whole chili.
My head burned, I cried and almost threw up.

At least three of my twitter followers are the same size as I am.
