# Hire me, I'm not an idiot.

```irc
<jMCg> Since I only do admin stuff for Java, I am perfectly oblivious of how bad it is.
<zwoop> lucky you
<zwoop> it's actually not bad, it's just a really bad idea to only teach students Java
<zwoop> it'd be like teaching a medical student only how to use the medical equipment, not understanding why
<zwoop> anywho
<jMCg> "You can cut things with this. Oh, and careful with the bleeders."
<zwoop> exactly
<zwoop> "Wtf, people die if you cut the wrong artery??"
<zwoop> Java people do the exact same, picking the wrong containers (or algorithm) because they simply don't understand the implications
<jMCg> You can only chose the wrong algorithm or the wrong container if you've never heard of the concepts of time and space, or never understood them in school.
<zwoop> yet, it happens every day, in every Java project
<jMCg> IIRC, in a standard CS.. thing.. there's a Algorithms and Datastructures course... If you fail that, you fail at programming.
<zwoop> Europe probably is better than the US
<zwoop> i've interviewed a zillion "senior java developers" who can't tell a linked list from a unordered map â€¦.
<jMCg> :-S
<zwoop> indeed
<jMCg> wow. That's bad. I mean, even I can, and I'm "just" an admin.
<zwoop> there are exceptions, but few and far in between
<jMCg> Fuck, I should goto US and have them hire me as genius.
<zwoop> +1
<zwoop> Senior Genius
