# Ancient Greek History
It was when the greek nations were united under the oath to protect Helena and lead by brother kings Menelaus and Agammemnon to war against Troy, that one of the most complex and remarkable stories was retold by the blind poet, Homer.

The Iliad tells the final of the 10 year war of the Greeks against Troy. Like most greek philosophy, mythology and history it leaves us (the western civilization) with many a gift. One of them is the Trojan Horse.

The masterplan by the genial strategist Odysseus to invade the now weakened Trojans. The huge wooden horse, made from the last of the trees left after the years of war, was to seem like a symbol of accomodation in the upcomming peace talks. But it was in fact filled with Greek soldiers. Once within the fortress of Troy, they stormed out as soon as the night fell, killing everyone inside. The End.

Snap to today. In a technological contextÂ we have Trojan Horses too. They are Malware, that disguises as a game for instance. But in recent years people have become lazy, and started calling it just Trojans.[^1]

Lazyness in language development is a natural process. However calling a "Trojan Horse" a "Trojan" reverses it's meaning! This doesn't call so much for lazyness in language, as it calls for the same in thinking.

I'm thinking to start calling them greeks or horses, just to irritate people.
