following [@\_danillo](https://twitter.com/_danillo)'s recent article on [Y
Combinator](http://danilocampos.com/2014/09/y-combinator-and-the-negative-externalities-of-hacker-news/),
i've tried to collect my thoughts on communities

<span class="more"></span>

> communities that are not built on inclusivity, can be turned around, but will
> retain an exclusive core

we can try to "fix" communities such as HN, however it remains a challenge:
there is a strong resistance from within an exclusive club of any kind to
remain exclusive, no matter how that makes the external image that this
resistance paints look like.

> all geek communities are built on some kind of exclusivity

this is painting with a pretty sweeping brush, but i maintain that most
communities, and in particular most *geek* communities are built around an *us,
not them* mentality:

this is exemplary in almost all programming language and technology communities:

* linux, not windows or osx, …
* ubuntu, not fedora, or…
* kde, not gnome,
* emacs, not vi\*, …
* python, not ruby, …
* &c…

and it turns toxic.

> building communities from inclusivity is actually more challenging

[@whycomputer](https://twitter.com/whycomputer) ([computer
anonymous](http://computeranonymous.org/)) tries to counter that hypothesis,
and build on mutual respect and understanding (or misunderstanding of
"computer" ;), while being fully aware how easy it is to mis-step.

*how* hard it is to embrace criticism has most recently been demonstrated by the
geek / gamer community with [#gamergate](https://twitter.com/hashtag/gamergate).
