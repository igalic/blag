# Newbies on The Internet vs Other fields

I know that writing software and running it on servers isn't exactly [rocket science](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/02/16/9964049.aspx).
But there's one thing I do not understand - even though I believe that us IT folks have greatly contributed to it:

Newbies.

What if I went to the University, sat down into a lecture on QED and after some time decided that

> LOLZ! U ALL SUX! HA HA! CAN HAS MAD SKILLZ PLS SO I CAN PWNZ U ALL WIT MA LAZER! NOW!!!

Nobody does that in academia, or hardly any field worth speaking of, for that matter.

Yet in IT, because information is free - and the human resources readily available to help the newbies seem infinite, this is seen every day.

I'm not sure if elitism is the way to go, but I do believe that we deserve a little more respect.

The wonderful [Carl Zimmer](http://carlzimmer.com/) has posted an article discussing his [recent experience with students](http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/05/31/an-open-letter-to-science-students-and-science-teachers/).
It seems the kind of attitude we've seen in IT, and in particular in Open Source has leaked into other fields.

I'm not surprised.
The first Internet generation we've been complaining about in Open Source and IT for over two decades now, has gone ahead and radically reshaped not just The Internet, but with also society.
That generations attitude has shaped not just how we access information, but also our expectations about that information and the world in general.

To the new generation growing up in this world - today's high school students - a scientist is as easily accessible as upper-class school colleague might have been ten or thirty years ago.
Students approach them with the same brashness as they would have if it were an upper-class colleague.
Added to that however, is a disconnect.
In the end the scientists at the end of an email-conversation is so distant from an perception that they might as well not be real people.
(Since scientist, especially those at the end of an email conversation, don't pose the same threat to bodily harm as upper-class mates would, you can even hurl insults, if they don't comply)

Perhaps I'm too bleak about this.
Perhaps this new generation, once it grows up, will actually be able to express, what writers of today still fail.
I'll leave you with the [words](http://www.quinnnorton.com/said/?p=721) of [Quinn Norton](http://www.quinnnorton.com/):

> [Quinn Norton's words](http://www.quinnnorton.com/said/?p=721) There is an aesthetic crisis in writing, which is this:
> how do we write emotionally of scenes involving computers?
> How do we make concrete, or at least reconstructable in the minds of our readers, the terrible, true passions that cross telephony lines? Right now my field must tackle describing a world where falling in love, going to war and filling out tax forms looks the same; it looks like typing.
