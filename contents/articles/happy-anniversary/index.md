# Happy Aniversary

Today is April the 24th.
Today is my brother's birthday.
Today is the second time I was invited to Vienna Hackergarden.
Today is Tuesday, TV-show evening with friends.

I'm not attending any of those events today, because today also marks a year since I started therapy and to me that is a good enough excuse.
Tonight, I look back in annoyance, what has changed since then, while silencing the phone every couple of minutes.

I was in ZÃ¼rich when I talked to my future therapist for the first time over the phone.
I established that I had two goals:

- realize that something's up before depression hits and brings me down
- find strategies to avert it, before it happens

So far I've been marginally successful with the first part.
I know the signs, they are more than obvious: Secluding myself from friends and family members, sometimes even fleeing the country.
I don't go to parties, or other social events, and if I do, I leave early.
I get up late, and in silent hope I can turn around *something* for this day, stay up late.
In the end, I don't answer the phone.

So, there you have it, 40 hours of therapy and now even Captain Obvious knows *when* Depression is banging on his front door.

What I haven't found, what seems, infinitely harder to pin down, is *why*.

I have a couple of ideas, most of which sound self-deprecating enough to fit my usual sense of humour.
I just really wish my brain was joking when it comes up with this shit.

What I do know is that I thrive on my sense of accomplishment when I'm doing fine, while simultaneously doing everything to undermine and misrepresent every single one of my accomplishments to either me or anyone around me.
I am, often actively, sabotaging myself not to be successful, just in case, you know, it turns out I'm not successful.

While the logic behind this baffles my mind, the realization isn't really all that shocking.
I must've known somehow, after all I've played a big part in it.

Once the feeling of success and accomplishment wanes, or rather, once I've finally managed to crush my own spirit, my brain will then tell me:

> There. Told ya, didn't I?

And of course it did, and of course it came true, according to the prophecy.

I think it's no use trying to find strategies to avert an incoming depression.
I haven't researched yet if that's even possible without a heavy dose of drugs, or dolphins.

My latest theory as to why my brain is sabotaging me: It's leeching of the emotional and psychological pain that it's causing me, similarly to the brains of self-injury victims leech of the physical pain.

I really hope my therapist has better ideas in this regard.
So I'm looking forward to another year (or shorter maybe?) in which I actually succeed in the battle of wits.
*The battle against my brain.*
