# Coming out
â€¦in which I write about something most of you (two or so readers) already know.

I'm crazy, insane, mad. Not in a so-to-speak way. No, in a very literal way. It's something I've been struggling with for years. Deciding to come out means admitting it, more than I've allowed myself to admit it so far.

I'm suffering from depression and I'm probably also slightly schizoid (n.b.: This is **not** the same as schizophrenia). - I don't know which is cause and which is effect, but they are there. One takes me out for months on end, usually in winter. I don't leave the house and hardly meet anyone. The other one makes me extremely awkward towards strangers, and makes it extremely difficult to form emotional connections.

I can pretend for long enough to be normal, so people who don't know me well wouldn't notice, but usually I introduce myself with: "I'm bad with people." Be it after we share a drink or a story, this statement is almost exclusively always dismissed.

Of course that is because pretending to be normal is perhaps the thing I'm second-best at. But I believe that the reason I am how I am today can be found in the art that I have truly mastered.

Many kids are raised by abusive parents, during times of war, fleeing their home, leaving half of their beloved family behind, lose friends and family members to war, or see them become cripples, have others die of cancer, or just turn up dead for unknown reasons, suicide is speculated. I was such a child. I also grew up between to countries - or rather, cultures: Between east and west. A billion kids deal with these things at this very moment - but I chose an easy way out. Sometime around 10 or 12, I decided to stop reacting emotionally or to react on emotion.

It hasn't always been like that, but I've come to be enormously proud of who I am. One way of achieving such self-satisfaction was accepting that the past is over, and you can't change that. Everything that happened in the past has contributed to you becoming the way you are, and that's a good thing. You're great, we love you!

Except, perhaps, when that decision I made fifteen years ago has crippled me for life. Not in a way that a bomb has crippled my uncle and my cousin. No, it didn't harm me physically - if anything, it has made me stronger.

I'm a skinny little guy. While I've trained three different martial arts, and know how to beat the stinking shit out of you, I'd never do that. It was always so much easier to let my opponents do the grunt work: I was able to calmly smile at bullies in school while they were beating me, I would get up when they actually managed to beat me to the ground and still smile a friendly smile at them. This helped earning the "crazy" label very early on. It made me untouchable.

But these things always go both ways. Becoming untouchable meant I would be unable to touch others, and after a while I got out of touch with humanity. And then with my own humanity.

It would take almost ten years for me to gain back enough trust towards another person to enter a romantic relationship. Most of that time I spent doing drugs and listening to music (I was a teenager after all), reading and writing (terribly, so no change here), drawing or painting, and, finally learning and hacking.

Some of these things are safe-harbours today. They help me get through the day when I'm unable to cope with the world. Ordering my thoughts by writing them down has been one of the therapeutically most valuable things I've come up with. Creating art has helped me express my inner worlds in abstract ways. By doing that I made the emotions that they inhibit less threatening and more accessible to myself.

Hacking, finally, is the way I would *like* to assess the world. Learning everything there is to know and trying it out until I've managed to comprehend it completely. Unfortunately the world doesn't give you a million chances to study repeatable behaviour, sometimes you'll get just one shot.

Music and drugs are on the other side of the spectrum - they make *me* emotionally accessible, and when I'm at my most vulnerable, they open me up. Sometimes they open up wounds I thought forever closed, sometimes they open up wounds I never knew could exist.

When you feel bad you don't go to parties because there's all those cheerful people, and meh. When I feel really bad, I don't go to parties because these cheerful people are my friends. I don't want to pretend to them that I'm okay, when I am in fact unable to connect to them. I don't want to try and connect to them with drugs, because I'd only hurt myself and I'd possibly hurt them too.

There's this kind of guy at parties - he's sitting quietly in a corner, sipping his drink, not talking to anyone, you know him. I'm the guy who doesn't go to the party. And that's what I've done for a long time now.

I'd stay alone at home, trying to deal with the frightening world inside of me which was incompatible with the frightening worlds outside the door. And I hit a wall. And I realized that I couldn't in fact do it alone. I've come a long way, but there's only so far you can go in matters of the mind and soul without help. I have help now, I'm in therapy, and I think I'm doing fine.

I'd like to close with a shout-out to [Bitch Media](http://bitchmagazine.org/) a feminist magazine dealing with mainstream media and pop culture. Their series ["we're all mad here"](http://bitchmagazine.org/tag/were-all-mad-here) was a great inspiration. While the articles are mostly dealing with mental illness as depicted in pop culture, there's a bazillion of links and then some more in the comments that will help you and your loved ones, or at least might help you understand.
