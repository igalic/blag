# Dear i,

long time no read. I hope you haven't entirely forgotten me.
I write you this letter from an unusually dark winter, as Shelly and I take a break, a breather,

<span class="more"></span>

to be together in undisturbed serenity.
For me it was a hard winter, mentally anyway (but you know how easily that affects me physically as well), and I sincerely hope that by the time this letter reaches you, you will have found yourself and be on more solid footing reading it, than I am writing it.

But this year wasn't just tough because I have lost a good friend.
It also brought me closer to my other friends in our mourning, and it drifted me away from them when I was faced with the uglier aspects of their personalities.
I hope you were able to pass those bridges, I hope you didn't burn *all* of them. I hope that if you did, you've sailed your ships to safer and friendlier havens.

This year has been quite a success â€” a claim I will make of every year I didn't run bankrupt, got jailed, or became permanently homeless.
My yardstick for measuring success (other than dismantling the patriarchy and crushing capitalism) is countries travelled, conferences attended (vs talks given [a ratio I'm putting in your hands to increase]), interesting interactions had, things learned and taught.

I already have lots of plans (for you obviously), but I'm curious about how your meter for success will change.
I know that for me, one of the biggest constants in life has always been change, and this is why, when writing from a dark time I'm hoping that yours will be brighter.
I hope you will retain and use that power of transformation and this is why my biggest plan for the coming year is to be true to myself.
I will leave the "how" and the judging of success in your hands.

I've known you for quite some time now, and you've always been an empathetic person, shielding yourself from sentimentality.
Don't feel bad for shedding a tear, or resentful, for I didn't mean to make you sad.
I would like to leave you with this:

> I have touched many people, I have connected to them and left a memory.

Maybe I'll be remembered.

Maybe the way I'll be remembered will be up to you.

In loving memory of pasts

I wish you the best of futures.

***i***
