# Crazy in Love

A friend of mine asked me a question via twitter:

> (@TwatterFwend) @hirojin do relationships between people suffering from similar/same mental illnesses ever work out? Just wondering... I might fall for one.

Name changed to protect the innocent.

As both of my faithful readers know, I am [well qualified](/2011/09/25/coming-out "Coming Out") for answering this question.
That is: I am a) CRAZY and I've b) been in a relationship with someone (equally) crazy.

And believe it or not, there's certainly perks to being with someone who is similar in one way or the other.
"Opposites attract," yeah, sure, but for a (long-term) relationship it's really nice to have someone you can relate to.
Unless we're talking about a serious diagnosis, it might just make for an interesting personality quirk: Something to make a person stand out.
Something to make a person even more lovable.

# Diagnosis

Perhaps the most important distinction is whether a condition has actually been diagnosed by a professional or not.
Self-diagnosing yourself and/or S.O. with ADHD, Asperger's or Autism might be *cute* and you can even identify with a whole [community of special and different beings](http://www.wrongplanet.net/ "Wrong Planet - Autism Community").
But seriously folks, if you suspect there's something wrong with you, please go see a professional.
If you suspect something to be wrong with your partner, you should advise him/her the same.

This holds doubly true for The Big Three:

**Depression**, **Bi-Polar Disorder**, and **Schizophrenia**

I can only talk of the first from personal experience, my now former girlfried was bi-polar.
I've had no experience with schizophrenia so far, and, frankly, I think my quota is filled anyway.

The nice thing about *not* being diagnosed is this beautiful uncertainty of "I could be normal." And worse yet, "I don't need treatment, because I could be normal."

So let's talk about

# Treatment

I'll go cold turkey on this: There are a couple of methods, it depends on you which one will work:

- Therapy
- Medication
- both
- (long-term) hospitalization (preferably with one or both of the above)

In case of The Big Three treatment is not optional.
Treatment can be the basic premise for forming a relationship.
If someone opts out, that's breach of the agreement.
If someone opts out without telling the other, that's a breach of trust - and this often ends relationships between "normal" couples, so why should it be any different with us?

If one of you is hospitalized for longer time, this can essentially turn your relationship into a long-distance one.
I'm not very fond of long-distance relationships myself.
Being apart alone can put additional emotional stress on a couple, and here I'm not even talking about dealing with clinic personnel, edgy relatives, a shitty work-schedule that somehow doesn't want to fit into even shittier visiting hours.

Never having been hospitalized myself (for my mental issues anyway) I can only report from the other side.
However, a good friend of mine has been working for a couple of years as caregiver for people with special needs (that is, physical or mental disabilities).
He reports that most of his patients had healthy relationships (well, some had soap-opera like dramas), or at least a healthy sex life.
(While he was running dry, yes.)

Love blossoms anywhere, and it doesn't care whether societal norms will give their blessing or not.

The main problem with societal norms is that they are moving too slowly.
Especially with pop culture perpetuating the same stereotypical images from two hundred years ago, this is unlikely to change anytime soon.[^1]

Crazy people in love might be considered cute, as long as they don't consider something crazy like, say, having kids.[^2]

See, if we don't challenge society nothing will change, ever.
So let's see

# What this boils down to

Like any other relationship there are a couple things that are absolutely essential and you should already know that, but I'll repeat them just in case you've spent the last seven years holed up in a dark room.
(Unlike me! Ha ha ha...)

## Trust

I already mentioned trust [above](#treatment), but I'm repeating well known facts so why not repeat this one as well:

Trust is the single most important pillar in your relationship.
Once it falls, the house of cards will follow suit.

## Equality

Equality is not only important because we're modern men and feminism has happened.
This is a different issue that other people are more intelligently and more intelligibly discussing than I can or am willing to in the narrow scope of this article.

No, what I am talking about is being with someone on eye level: A relationship cannot work if you're looking down on your partner.
But it will equally fail if you're looking up to your partner.

For some reason geeks love doing that: They love to raise their *Goddess* on a pedestal.
Strangely, I've been in the past in this role: I was put on a pedestal.
It's a problematic position.
You're in a high place, but it's also in a narrow space.
Moving too much might cause you to fall from grace.
Then, very soon, you'd be in the reverse position: You'd be looked down.

You don't want either, you want to be on eye level with your partner at any time.
This is particularly important when defining or negotiating...

## Limits

... of any kind, such as **physical** (including, but not limited to **sexual**), **emotional**, **financial**, etc...
Here's some examples:

"If you ever hit me, I'll leave you and take the kids with me." -- this I suspect is something rather common in my old home country.

"Anal Sex is a NO GO." â€” interestingly my former girlfriend's best friend, while otherwise "normal", was into SM, but not into this.
(And refused to understand why her friend was.)[^3]

Ideally both partners can stand on their own feet and walk their own path, while choosing to walk it together.
When one of you needs to lean on the other, is that okay? What if both need someone to lean on? What if it's progressed so far that someone needs to be carried?

How far are you willing to go? Self-abandonment? No, you don't want that, because then you'd not be equals.
Especially with The Big Three, there should be a clear limits when you need to step away and have a professional step in.

You should define these limits of how much you are ready to take and how much you are able to give.
Or you should negotiate them over time - and please remember such things are always open for renegotiations without prior notice.
Which brings us to

## Communication

Remember that first time you both were fucking like rabbits until you were too exhausted to move? Afterwards you were too excited to sleep, so you stayed up all night long, TALKING.

Please, please, please, KEEP THAT UP.
(Both of those ;)

I have ruined most of my past relationships because I didn't talk about the important matters.
Or things I didn't understand, like: Emotions.

If you're anything like me, and I faithfully hope you're not, then you have no idea of what emotions are.
That is: Your own, your partner's or anyone's for that matter.

Even if that isn't the case, you MUST talk about the stirrings of your inner life, and for spicing up the monotone: The musings of your fantasies.

This shit is what keeps relationships alive.
Either that or extravagant hobbies and mistresses and lovers.
If you're planning to be monogamous (this is part of the negotiations), I sincerely hope that you have some kind of basis of communication.

# TL;DR

To cut it short: Yes, it can work out, but it means work - and yes, perhaps it means you have to invest more energy than normal couples.
However, I think the most important step is the awareness that you have issues.
Add, if you can, to this the sensitivity and humility that your partner has these issues too.
And if your partner brings these same virtues to the table, then yes, I think it can definitely work.

Finally: The soundtrack for this article was "Crazy in Love" (my favourite version being the one by Snow Patrol), as well as "Love the way you lie"
