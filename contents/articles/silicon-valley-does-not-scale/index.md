# Silicon Valley Does Not Scale

*n.b.: Some of the things in this text may not be well researched, because it's 01:43 and I couldn't be bothered.
I may fix that at a later point.*

When technologists express themselves, it is usually in technological terms.
The reason we get away with this is because our target audience is almost wholly made up of other technologists.
We speak in jargon.
We speak in our echo chamber.
We speak unchecked by society.
A society we have shaped and transformed for the past four decades.

This is problematic.
This is especially problematic when I am asked what the biggest problem in technology is these days and I say something like

> Silicon Valley does not scale.

A lot of technology that is coming out of Silicon Valley these days has a very limited cultural scope.
Either it fully emerges out of Silicon Valley, or else technologists from somewhere else in the United States move to Silicon Valley because they feel that this is where technology now happens.
This is where they can innovate.
This is where they have to be to innovate.
Some of them may dream of changing the world.
Most of them succumb to the call of the money.[^1] A call that almost exclusively either comes from big companies, or from "lean" startups that aspire to be bought by big companies.

This is problematic.
It's problematic because it creates a monoculture within a monoculture.
When we only cater the interest of the few big companies who have set their goal posts a long time ago, how can we even possibly believe that we are innovating anything?

Even with companies that have interests as widely spread apart as [advertisement](https://www.google.com/ads/), [telephony](http://www.google.com/chat/voice/), [archiving of books](http://books.google.com/), [video streaming](https://www.youtube.com/), [smart phones](http://www.android.com/), [social media](https://plus.google.com/), etc..., we are still concentrating an awful lot of potential, energy and talent into a handful of companies.

I am convinced that our continued trend to concentrate power in these few companies will lead us no where.
At least not where we, as a society aspire to be.
Societal changes are driven by a number of factors: idealism, opportunity, momentum...
This is not because companies cannot have idealism, create or use opportunities, and drive momentum.
The vision behind all this buzz will be severely limited.

So we are back at the scalability problem.
Silicon Valley does not only *not* scale because it is one place, with [horrendous rent and angry neighbourhood](http://www.thebolditalic.com/articles/4294-an-open-letter-to-the-tech-community), in a single time-zone.
Silicon Valley does not scale because the culture that emerges from it is self-selected, monotone and [oblivious](https://news.ycombinator.com/) as to what impact that has on the world or how to change it.

The term "[Global Village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_village_%28term%29)" did not emerge with The Internet.
However it is The Internet that fully validates its prediction:

> The next medium, whatever it is - it may be the extension of consciousness - will include television as its content, not as its environment, and will transform television into an art form.
> A computer as a research and communication instrument could enhance retrieval, obsolesce mass library organization, retrieve the individual's encyclopedic function and flip into a private line to speedily tailored data of a saleable kind.

We are now raising a generation, and without our involvement, they are growing up in two parallel worlds.
One the surface, their only distinction is the speed and the latency at which any kind of exchange happens.
This new generation knows better.
They know that these two worlds are as different as the ones described by Classical Physics and Quantum Mechanics.
Yet there are thousands of companies, employing millions of people who are trying to impose physical rules on this ephemeral world.
They are trying to build empires in the image of all the failed ones that have come before them.
Failing, one after the other, tragically, or comically, like all empires in all of history have.

I believe it's possible to build empires on The Internet.
Perhaps The Internet is the only place that empires can be created, to exist forever, or to be reinvented on the spot.
If we allow the like-minded to find each other, to gather and thrive.
This is what The Internet has been doing since its inception.
Critically missing is multi-faceted physical component.

After all, humans are still physical beings.
For ten thousands of years to be social has meant to also be physically close.
The social media on The Internet has successfully highlighted an overpowering tension in us: the people who are physically close to us are not necessarily the ones whom we feel ideologically, philosophically or otherwise close.
They may be our kin, but we don't feel that they are our family.
This has always been the case, but now that Global Village is a reality, our wanderlust is no longer a risk.
Often times it's not even a life-altering event anymore.

All of this would sound near utopic, were it not for the details.
When we look at who is actually moving where, we notice that [those who wealthy](http://swombat.com/2014/1/10/money-and-wealth) are moving where they can turn their potential.
For technologists those are clusters such as Silicon Valley.
So we have capitalism undermining our Utopia.
Even those idealists who think they revolutionize the world are still under[mining](http://www.bitcoinmining.com/) it, quite literally.

There may be wisdom in the crowd, but there is no vision.

Perhaps this next generation will accept this duality.
Perhaps they will stop trying to build physical empires.
Perhaps they will use their small neighbourhood communities for their own [betterment](http://repaircafe.org/), and build their invincible empires in the Realm of The Unimmpossible: The Internet.
