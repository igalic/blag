# George

Silently she stepped into the apartment and noticed his shoes immediately.
It's not like George always wore the same shoes, it's just that his shoes always looked worn.

Wendy loved her Uncle, and she didn't…
quite know.
George was *so* easy going with them kids, yet, lately, she couldn't help but notice how grown up - not to say *old* - he was.
Wendy wasn't foolish, she knew well that his was no age, but it was at times like these, when she heard him talk to the grown ups, and to her parents in particular that she almost distrusted him, feared him, hated him and hated herself for feeling that way because she *new* she'd grow up to become the same as he was.

Moving between a childish naïvety and a cynical darkness that you notice once you accept that you too have a dark side.
Wendy almost hoped she'd grow up to be like that, because maybe then she'd understand what grown ups thought of George.

The reason George's shoes always looked so worn, was because he actually traveled the world.
Stepping through foreign countries with a spring in his step, walking through deserts and unknown cities the same.
With child like naïvety and most of the time without a single credit on his card - if he had a card or anything for that matter about his person.

Most members of the family were, simply said, astonished how he was still alive, others wondered, sincerely, why he wasn't dead yet.

How he could afford that penthouse in Seattle where he didn't even spend half the year, or what exactly his "consultant" job was, nobody even wanted to know - rather they would gossip.
Oh, how Wendy hated the gossip.

Whenever she had a chance, whenever George was in town, she'd "accidentally" run into him and talk.
Just talk for hours.
You see, while George was a good ten years younger than her father, he sounded a lot like someone Wendy never had: A grandfather.

Tonight, she had the chance to hear him talk without having to ask, or as she sometimes thought, embarrass herself.

"Listen, Micheal, I'm sick and tired of this talk.
I have *literally* been less drained when crossing Gobi, then I am right now coming from a stroll to your bullshit talk.
You are not my father, and frankly, even if you were, I would not be listening to your well prepared, well reasoned, and worst of all, well meaning advise, as I have refused to listen to his."

"Yes, the family does talk, yes settling down and starting a family of my own is perfectly reasonable, and no, I still don't give two *fucks* about it."

"The reason I've been single for the past three years is not because there is no women or man - don't look at me like this! - ready to travel the world with me.
I got to know plenty, thank you Janet."

"The reason I don't settle down is because I enjoy my life alone.
I don't feel any sad loneliness that only can be filled with someone equally sad and lonely."

There was an uneasy, heavy silence, but Wendy's Uncle was far from done: Before her mother could even attempt to sigh, continued:

"And the reason why I don't put any sprog in this world is because I think there already are plenty of people on it - and more fucked up children than I would have cared to see.
And they certainly don't need someone fucked up like me as parent."

"And believe me one thing at least when I tell you - cuz I'm not talking about Nairobi, or Cambodia.
I've talked to your kids more than you have.
Do you even know where they are?"

"They've got RFID, George," Janet said, with resignation in her voice.
She hadn't seen her husband's brother in two months, but she hadn't heard this talk in two years.
She hoped he had grown out of it.
Looking over to Michael, her hope was soon gone.
He knew his brother.
Right now Michael had put on his stoic face.
Their father's stoic face.
In this moment George hated his brother and his dead father with all the passion they never had expressed.

"I'm leaving," George said abruptly, finished his drink and took for the door.

Wendy panicked, her face all red she didn't know what do do, where to go or what to say.

"Kiddo," he said with all the warmth he'd always do, brushing through her hair.
He slipped in his shoes, she tried to find her voice: "You… in a hurry?" A croak and a whisper was all she found.

He filled his lungs, straightening his back - there was a flicker of a smile on his face.
He looked down to her, nodded and was gone.

In the living room, Wendy could hear her mother asking: "Do you think he's in love again?" Vividly she pictured him cross his arms, press his lips together and nod.
"Do you think it's as hopeless as last time?", he replied?

As silently as Wendy had come, she now left.
She needed to find her brothers.
She needed to take her mind off of these things.
She didn't want to be involved in grown-up stuff.
Not yet.
Her thirteenth birthday was still so far away.
So much can happen in two days.
