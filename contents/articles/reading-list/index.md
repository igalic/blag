# Reading List

This weeks' reading list was exhaustive, here's a small selection sorted by subjects.

## Writing, Words…

[![Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can make me think I deserved it.](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sticks_and_stones.png)](http://xkcd.com/1216/ "Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can make me think I deserved it.")

Courtesy to xkcd, today we focus on Words! (btw, if sticks and stones are not your thing, maybe [chains and whips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdS6HFQ_LUc) are.

Let's start with a reminder to [Ben Hammersley's speech to the IAAC](https://www.benhammersley.com/2011/09/my-speech-to-the-iaac/) in which he calls himself a translation lawyer.. Someone who translates or oversees translation between two generations. Those who grew up during the cold war, and those who grew up on The Internet.

I don't know in how far Ben Hammersley is successful as a Translation Lawyer, [Quinn Norton on the other hand](http://www.quinnnorton.com/)…

> There is an aesthetic crisis in writing, which is this: how do we write emotionally of scenes involving computers? How do we make concrete, or at least reconstructable in the minds of our readers, the terrible, true passions that cross telephony lines? Right now my field must tackle describing a world where falling in love, going to war and filling out tax forms looks the same; it looks like typing.

## Education, Science

[Carl Zimmer's open letter to Teachers and Students](http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/05/31/an-open-letter-to-science-students-and-science-teachers/) in which he asks for a more serious treatment of the material and perhaps a more respectful treatment of the time of the scientists and writers. Phenomenal commentary! I myself am [not very surprised](/2010/03/20/newbies-on-the-internet-vs-other-fields#update-2013-06-02)

Dr David Goldstein of Caltech giving a detail history of [Whatever Happened to Cold Fusion?](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~dg/fusion_art.html) - a fascinating tale of now not to do science.

David Foster Wallace's [This Is Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFt7EzpsZQo): powerful words. I had to look him up on Wikipedia, because the video reported his untimely death at the age of only 46. I found that he took his own life, following his life-long struggle with depression. His chanting of "This is water. This is water," reminds me of my own "This is real. This is real." His suicide, an eerie reminder that depression can cut a life short.
Thoughts: No amount of radical actions will be able to transform this society as much as radical thought: "I am not the center of the universe," and the thought that "I am not alone."

Since I don't want to end on a downer here are some truly frightening tales from the Crypt: [PHP Manual Master Pieces](http://phpmanualmasterpieces.tumblr.com/) by [0xabad1dea](http://0xabad1dea.github.io/)
