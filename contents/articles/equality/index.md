# equality

i've started reading a [book on lisp](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/). as Alan Perlis said:

>  A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing. 

but this chapter title:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>&quot;Truth, Falsehood, and
Equality&quot; — sounds like a chapter from legend of korra</p>&mdash; The
Wrath of PB™ (@hirojin) <a href="https://twitter.com/hirojin/status/557255799144480769">January 19, 2015</a>
</blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


made me think beyond programming. i've been contemplating this in terms of
political systems & stories, and i'm thinking that there's no chance to achieve
*radical* equality:

<span class="more"></span>

societies change over generations, as do their their stories. and while, as
societies, we frown at those (ancient or contemporary) societies that use
murder of prisoners and slaves as entertainment, our *stories* are filled with
such things.

the fight for power.  
the struggle against corrupt power.  
we even have to fight for love.

we have no need for equality, because the stories we are raised with neither
prepare us for what such an equal society would look like, nor do they raise a
desire to achieve it.

we are inching ourselves towards it. that's societal change over generations.
i'm starting to fear the only way we know how to radically change is to erase
the past, and that would be profoundly dangerous.

even more dangerous than forgetting the (often recent) past, and *regress* into
"good old" patterns.
