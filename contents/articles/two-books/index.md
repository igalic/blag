# Two Books
Joey Comeau's [*The Complete Guide to Lockpick Pornography*](http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Lockpick-Pornography-Joey-Comeau/dp/1770410694/ "The Complete Lockpick Pornography") is a refreshing novel in that its characters are uncompromising in their ways - be it in their queerness, their unapologetic nature, or their honest na√Øvety when it comes to how they think the world works.

The first part, Lockpick Pornography, takes us from an anarchist campaign to spread queerness to a kidnapping. Our four main characters, each queer in their own way, not only explore their own and each other's sexuality, as the title suggests, but through their efforts and adventure grow in a way they didn't expect when they set out.

The second part, "We all had it coming," concentrates on one character (it is unclear whether he is the main character of the previous story only older): We accompany Arthur and his bisexual lover as they explore different aspects of violence, and unsuspectingly stumble into others.

They don't escape unscathed from their journey - in the end they find love.

Lockpick Pornography was one of those books I finished in a rush: Two nights in a row and I was done. It was an easy read because it wasn't difficult to identify with the characters. Joey Comeau brought to live some of the most authentic and likeable people. Reading his book made me wish I had read it ten years earlier - had been part of such a movement. Reading about the inside story, "Johnny is a Girl, sometimes," makes me wish he would write this illustrated children's book. Perhaps for me to read twenty years ago.

In [*How to Talk So Kids Can Learn*](http://www.amazon.com/How-Talk-Kids-Can-Learn/dp/0684824728/ "How To Talk So Kids Can Learn") we follow Liz Lander, elementary school teacher, through her first three years of teaching.

She sets out with the plan not to become one of those teachers she hated so much in school and promptly becomes one. She wants to improve, so together with Jane, Martha and Ken she uses the book "*[How to talk so Kids will Listen and Listen so Kids will Talk](http://www.amazon.com/How-Talk-Kids-Will-Listen/dp/1451663889/ "How to Talk So Kids Will Listen & Listen So Kids Will Talk")"* and applies it to her teaching methods.

Jeff Attwood of Codinghorror fame recommended the latter, and I latched at it because of how useful it promised to be in regard to communication. I accidentally bought this one, but really, I don't think it really matters which you read.

I'll be honest with you people: There was not a single chapter in this book that didn't make me cry like a baby watching Bambi's mommy die, over and over again.

Now, of course, I grew up in an abusive household and I had some of the worst teachers in the history of teaching, so reading about how you could treat those kids in a humane, respectful way, and, in all interactions make sure to maintain their dignity, made me all teary eyed, but what I'm getting at here is this:

If you are a teacher, or a parent, or are planning to become one, or if you are otherwise interacting with human beings, you should stop everything you are doing and buy a book from this series and read it right now.

Reading it will make you a better parent, teacher, co-worker, boss, or doctor. It will make you a better lover, and a better citizen. It might even help you transform yourself into the person you always wanted to be.
