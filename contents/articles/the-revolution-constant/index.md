# The Revolution Constant

I've never been a political person.
At least not in the sense that I would commit to a political fraction.
The last couple of days, weeks, and months however, have frequently prompted in me the idea that maybe I should.
But perhaps I should first figure out what my political leanings are.

While I do that, here's a thought that's been bugging me..

## Burn it with fire

Revolution, as many people understand it, is an igniting event.
Such as, burning down the parliament for instance.
Once we have burned down the parliament however, there is an almost immediate need to fill the void that burning down the parliament has left.
A void that cannot be filled with the enthusiasm of burning things down alone.

A less idealistic, and more realistic view of revolution is that it's a process.
Something that happens over months, years, decades, generations.

Does that put oppression, which inevitably leads to revolution, as a function of revolution? That revolution with its ideas and ideals can only be born from oppression and terror is a bleak outlook at best.
But this cynical view is most of all unambitious! We should aiming higher than that.

## Rebooting the Franchise

Societies are built on ideals.
They fall apart when trying to conserve the corrupted skeletons those ideals once were.
Next time we build a new society, we should build it on one ideal only: that rebooting the system not only is possible, but encouraged.
A society built on The Constant Revolution.
Constantly rebuilding and refining itself.
