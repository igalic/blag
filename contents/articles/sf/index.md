a while ago i wrote some *opionated* stuff about how [sillicon valley "doesn't
scale"](../sillicon-valley-does-not-scale). it was "informed" by my one-day
visit, and my [twitter feed](../how-i-use-twitter).

now, having spent half a week here my feelings towards it are… different:

san francisco has impressed me in equal parts as it has horrified me. by
western standards, the closest i can compare it to is cairo.

i cannot remember a western city i have visited with more homeless people.
even portland, a magnet for the lgbtqi youth no longer welcome at their own
homes doesn't even come close. but most of all, it doesn't come close in
hopelessness.

the contrast between haves and have-nots is stark. and, startlingly, it's spread
out equally across the entire vastness of the "main" city, and it's peripheral
towns.

what i cannot understand is how all those people in their startups can live
here, founding, often one ~~company~~ startup after the other, and yet they
keep believing in technology, the great equalizer, and capital, the just.
