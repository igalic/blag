# Secrets

I said "I don't know" so many times I convinced myself I really don't know.
I don't remember. I don't remember so well, I don't even remember what I don't remember.
I shut my mouth, and didn't say a word. I mustn't become a snitch.

> Are your friends worth all these beatings? Are your secrets?

I don't say a word. I try hard not to cry.

> Are you worth your secrets?

I heavily sigh.
A Hit. A Smack.
Something breaks inside.

"I don't know," I say, "I don't know what they are."
