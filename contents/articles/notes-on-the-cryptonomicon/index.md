# Notes on The Cryptonomicon

Enoch Root, from the "Cryptonomicon", (check this out for a [full quote of the dialogue](http://realgem.blogspot.com/2005/04/more-about-morphine.html "realgem - More about morphine"))

> "I don't like the word 'addict'" (...)
>
> (...) "In the same way, morphine-seeky means that you always have the tendency to look for morphine, even if you are not looking for it at the moment.
> But I prefer both of them to 'addict', because they are adjectives modifying Bobby Shaftoe instead of a noun that obliterates Bobby Shaftoe."

What's the adjective for *"hacker"*?
