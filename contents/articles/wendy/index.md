# Wendy
The woman outside the café’s huge window was all dressed from head to foot. The only bits of skin you could see were her hands, carrying three target bags packed to the rim, and her swollen face - a pointed nose staring from under headscarf. She stopped not even two feet away from Wendy. She sighed a deep sigh, changed one of the bags to the other hand, straightened her back and continued her rut.

If it wasn’t for the window, Wendy was sure, she could have reached out and touched her. At least that’s what she liked to think when running her fingers across the pad in front of her. All the world’s knowledge a glass plate away. And yet she couldn’t feel it. She couldn’t hope to imagine what the women with the swollen face and the equally swollen feet felt when she took off again. And she couldn’t hope to imagine where her swollen feet would take her today.

She looked down her pad. “All the world’s knowledge - none of its wisdom,” echoed the voice in her head exactly as she felt. She noticed the smears on the lean device and they made her think of parental love. Of the richer kids who didn’t have no smears on their pads - and of the really rich who didn’t even own any to begin with. Who needs that middle class shit? Wendy was a little upset with the voice in her head and she couldn’t quite pin down if it was because the voice kept saying “shit” - a word her parents weren’t very fond of, especially since her little baby brothers had picked it up from her. Or was it because she was - perhaps just in her head, right at this moment - equating parental love to smears on her pad. She tried to remember a better time - and it didn’t escape her attention that she saw her parents smile a lot more when her baby brothers weren’t around yet. Or saw them, for that matter.

Quickly, Wendy grabbed her cup of tea which was slowly getting colder, while she kept staring out the window, no longer even pretending to pay attention to the lesson. She’d have to watch it again if she wanted to have even the slightest chance of understanding thaumatic engineering.

Her thirteenth birthday was drawing closer, she thought while taking the cup of tea as close to her body as she felt she could without looking ridiculous, trying to inhale the last bits of warmth that the outside of Seattle couldn’t give her.

The words of the professor were long fading, mixing with the buzz of the café. She took off her headphones and, without looking, put them neatly besides the pad. She took a satisfied gulp from the cup and kept staring outside, wondering if she shouldn’t maybe start one of those bad habits most of her friends already had. Tea was definitely a little ill fitting for a soon to come teenage, and while coke or speed she didn’t really care for, angel dust did strike her fancy.

From the corner of her eye she noticed the lesson closing, so she dared to tab over to the video mixing program, giving it a tough stare down while gripping her cup just a little tighter. She found herself sighing a deep sigh. And like that woman she couldn’t tell where that heaviness was coming from, nor where it would take her. All she knew was that no great remixes would be created today. At least not by her.

She took a deciding drag of musty café air, abandoned her cup and put on her coat against the ever persistent Seattle drizzle.

“Soon I won’t be a child any more,” the voice in her head said. While technically Wendy had to agree, she couldn’t grasp what that was supposed to mean.

The coat wasn’t enough a shield. This weather and the mood called for a frown.
