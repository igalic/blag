# Not quite Meritocracy

Over the past couple of months the debate around "meritocracy" that has existed of a few years now has intensified.

Even though it has been long exposed that its root lie in [satire](http://www.garann.com/dev/2012/you-keep-using-that-word/), there are still those of us who want to hold onto *The Ideal of Meritocracy*.
However, if you dare looking underneath the cover of the ideal you'll notice that

<span class="more"></span>

> "A meritocracy is a system for centralizing authority in the hands of those who already have it, and ensuring that authority is only distributed to others like them or those who aren't but are willing to play by their rules."

I can't say I'm too sad about the ongoing dismantling of meritocracy.
Despite having profited from it myself, and handsomely so, a [constant feeling of inadequacy](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Imposter_syndrome) has hung over my head like the sword of Damocles.
I'm glad new voices are barging into "our" space to point out the obvious.
I'm happy that we are finally seeing an actual democratization of that space.

Or rather, the beginnings of thereof.
Democracy too, like other hard things such as Security, is a process.
It is not an feature, and certainly not one that can be achieved simply by declaring that one adheres to an *ideal*.
Perhaps we should cut our losses and call meritocracy what it actually is: A flowery Euphemism for Oligarchy.

This is not to say that our "meritocratic" system is free of achievements.
This Internet and all the platforms and mediums are a fine accomplishment[^1].
Portals like Tumblr have given voices to people [previously unheard](http://everydaysexism.tumblr.com/), or [afraid of speaking up](http://thisiseverydayracism.tumblr.com/).
The people who are lending their voices to these new media have been extremely [wary](https://twitter.com/nataliereed84/status/460176505566277632) of giving more validity to the old systems which they consider broken.
Yet they are equally wary of not using the host of information that already exists within them[^2] to rebuild, or at least remodel the world.

The trends I'm seeing in FOSS and Pop Culture have long since started to show up in "more important"[^3] areas.
I'm hoping that more people are be willing to question the structures that make up our political systems.
The [democracies and republics of this world](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10769041/The-US-is-an-oligarchy-study-concludes.html), as well as our [economies](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2014/05/01/Piketty-Capital) need to face the same kind of scrutiny.

[^1]: Even if I still find that the [trend towards services](https://twitter.com/hirojin/status/460880881222443008) is a reversal of all that is good :(
[^2]: Albeit not always [freely accessible to anyone](https://www.openaccessbutton.org/)â€¦
[^3]: What's more important that popular culture? No seriously: What has a bigger influence on us than that?
