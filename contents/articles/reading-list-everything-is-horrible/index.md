# Reading List: Everything is horrible

Last week was pretty horrible news-wise.

While in Austria and Germany some Genius decided to safest bet for tackling the finance crisis is to [get out of the EURO](http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/economist/diebilanz/1415171/index.do) (spoiler alert, it's not.), the US was starting it's slow decline into a paranoid surveillance state. The first news that hit us was of [Verizon](http://guardiannews.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order). And then it got worse when the news about [PRISM hit the channels](http://marketingland.com/prism-the-tech-companies-monitoring-versus-requests-47562
). The president was [defending the program](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/06/obama-defends-digital-spying-i-think-weve-struck-the-right-balance/) by saying: 

> You can't have 100% security" and "100% privacy, and also zero inconvenience.

Fuck. That. Noise. Allow me quote another famous man from the US:

> Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.

For those who suffer for completeness, the EFF has put together a timeline of [NSA spying](https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying/timeline). Intelligent commentary comes from many sides. Bruce Schneier's Atlantic article about [What we don't know](http://theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/06/what-we-dont-know-about-spying-on-citizens-scarier-than-what-we-know/276607/) is scary and acurate and prompted me to look up [ECHELON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON). It's an eerie reminder that PRISM is [not an exclusively American problem](http://carta.info/59552/prism-ist-kein-originar-amerikanisches-phanomen/) (article in German), and the reason I'm writing [mails to my ISP](/2013/06/09/email-to-isp) to get all that precious data they store "for" me. Finally, contemporary artist Ai Weiwei [compares the US behaviour to that of China](http://guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/11/nsa-surveillance-us-behaving-like-china).

I'm not even going to go into the persecution of Edward Snowden (the person who leaked the info to the press). Instead marvel at how anti-nuclear peace protestors have been [turned into dangerous terrorist by the justice system](https://www.commondreams.org/view/2013/05/15-7), or how the Steubenville hacker — who exposed rapists — is [facing charges 5-10 times of those who perpetuated the crime](http://motherjones.com/politics/2013/06/kyanonymous-fbi-steubenville-raid-anonymous).

## Well, that's pretty horrible, can't get much worse..

..actually, it can. [Texas says it's okay](http://gawker.com/texas-says-its-ok-to-shoot-an-escort-if-she-wont-have-511636423)

> (http://gawker.com/texas-says-its-ok-to-shoot-an-escort-if-she-wont-have-511636423) to use deadly force to recover property during a nighttime theft.

I won't say anything other than, please don't read the comments.

[ABC did an experiment](http://abcnews.go.com/WhatWouldYouDo/bike-theft/story?id=10556016#.UbejthUvC01) on Racial Profiling, and everyone proved [*how* racist they are](http://www.upworthy.com/know-anyone-that-thinks-racial-profiling-is-exaggerated-watch-this-and-tell-me-when-your-jaw-drops-2?g=3&c=upw1)

## Death is not the end..

But then, Iain Banks died, and I still hadn't read The Wasp Factory. Until I do and grace you with insights, have some of his [immortal quotes](http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/7628.Iain_Banks). Because one death isn't enough, HP announced the [EOL of OpenVMS](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/06/10/openvms_death_notice/). I'm still hoping they'll follow the "Open" in its name and Open Source it.

## But io9 makes everything better

even *comments* on [The "Rapunzel Syndrome" Is a Little-Known Medical Horror](http://io9.com/the-rapunzel-syndrome-is-a-little-known-medical-horro-511604299) are a pleasure to read. More importantly — thanks to io9 — I rediscovered the wonderful [Bird and Moon](http://birdandmoon.com/index.html) comic.
