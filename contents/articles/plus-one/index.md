# Plus One
On Thursday, 4th February, 2010 I received and email from [noirin](http://blog.nerdchic.net/)

    Dear Igor,

    On behalf of the Apache Software Foundation HTTP Server Project, we
    are pleased to offer you SVN write access ("commit access") to the
    httpd project documentation repositories.

That caught me off-guard. Mostly because it was late, and I was tired out from debugging an issue that could've been solved actually reading ulimit(1) (provided you can find it anywhere). Also, because I didn't quite know how I earned this honour, other than by being persistently annoying ;)

So, today, after returning from [Brussels](/2010/02/09/fosdem-2010.html), I sent off the fax and an reply and was welcomed warm-heartedly:

```irc
<jMCg> Back from brussels, sent out fax, and an awkward reply to your mail. I'll go home now and do the rest tomorrow.
<noirin> Yay, cool
```

Or something like that anyway.

Next stop is the comitters-only Apache Retreat somewhere near Dublin, between 9th and 12th April.

I have not any more information at this point, all I know is that Noirin said: "Sign here, and come to Dublin!"

After FOSDEM, I already have two projects in mind for that event:

One of them is my pet-peeve: [Apache Performance Tuning](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/en/misc/perf-tuning.html) The other one is the as of yet (2.3.5) [very sparse](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/tags/2.3.5/modules/lua/docs/) mod\_lua [documentation](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/tags/2.3.5/docs/manual/mod/).
