<p>And yet, it's still somehow &quot;complicated&quot; — in my mind, anyway.
The many thousands of lines of C++ code I [STRIKEOUT:wrote] deleted for Apache Traffic Server didn't really count: I didn't get paid for that.
And really, I was just mostly a release manager, and a documentation copy/paster.</p>
<p>And neither did the thousands of lines of Ruby and Puppet code count, because that was just infrastructure automation, and infrastructure is, by default, invisible.</p>
<p class="last">I'm very glad Puppet happened to me. I got to know a lot of people who I consider dear friends, I co-started Voxpupuli, and Puppet &amp; Ruby inspired me to learn a bunch of Functional Programming languages, expanding my horizons from Erlang to Common Lisp &amp; Clojure, all the way to JavaScript.</p>

<p>So despite the fact that I wrote (or, deleted) a lot of code, I never considered myself a programmer, or a software engineer, or a coder (and I was long past romanticizing myself as hacker).</p>
<p>Then, one day this year, I told my boss (yes, self-employed contracters also have bosses), that I wasn't really sure I could be coming back next quarter.</p>
<p>In fact, I might not be coming back next month.</p>
<p>The new <strong>full-time</strong> (an attribute always greatly appreciated by managers) hire had a coöperation style which wasn't really appreciated by anyone who's actually had to work with him.</p>
<p>Instead of leaving, my boss askmed to transfer to a different team.</p>
<p>That team was developing an infrastructure provisioning tool in Go.</p>

<p>If you're building a web application, you would want to bring in resilience.</p>
<p>Resilience could mean any number of things: Such as splitting the app along different lines (of concerns) so that crashes don't affect vital parts, or adding metrics to eventually figure out why it's crashing to begin with.</p>
<p>With your rich experience of running and debugging a million different daemons, you might help »accelerate« your [STRIKEOUT:burnout] »burndown« chart, by writing less code.</p>

<li>Linux from Scratch manual of Programming?</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>There wasn't really a FreeBSD manual equivalent for programming (that I was aware of): A manual that comprehensively explains general concepts of programming as clearly as the FreeBSD manual explains the concepts of Unix system administration.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/">Linux from Scratch</a> equivalent would be incredibly helpful:</p>
<p class="last">If we look deeper into the LFS book, it takes us from a blank slate to a usable Linux Distro through relentless repetition: At every checkpoint we either have a working base, or have to debug — using only the limited methods we have learned, and only the tools we have <strong>built</strong> so far. Failing that, we have to start over.</p>

<p>There are books that fit this bill. They are few and far in between. Most of all, they are <strong>not</strong> the classically recommended books</p>
<p class="last">If you're not up-to-speed with programming at all yet and what to start out, then I can highly recommend the &quot;For Kids&quot; series of books.</p>

<p>Sometimes we have to bite the bullet and learn a new paradigm, but often enough we can get away with using parallels for understanding or exploring.
For me, one of the most powerful paradigms that I use <strong>daily</strong> is a REPL (read eval print loop).</p>
<p class="last">I use <a class="reference external" href="https://fishshell.com/">Fish</a> all day, and I suppose you use something similar. Now, first off: That's a REPL right there. But, what if I told you, that you could explore a programming language the same way you're exploring a (Unix) system?</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>To me, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pry</span></code> was a revelation. Once I found pry, I wanted every programming environment to have something like that! What actually happened, is that I would gravitate towards systems which had something like pry ;)</p>
<p>A powerful REPL is a good sign of a good tooling ecosystem that will let you browse, explore and auto-complete source code.
This might might represent a bit of a heretic departure from the classic Unix way of using just an editor, but, eh <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">¯\(°_o)/¯</span></code>.
If you want to dig through 330 thousand lines of 17 years old C++ code, you will want to use any trick and cheat that exists out there.</p>
<p class="last">Depending on your grasp of C++, 330KLoC could read like the first book of Game of Thrones (~298K words), or, like the entire series (1M 770k. thus far).
But unlike GoT, you can't read Apache Traffic Server's code from start to finish.
Where does it begin? Where does it end?? It's a mystery;)</p>

<p>So I lied. Obviously ;) There are good resources and good tools.</p>
