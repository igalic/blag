Hi folks, and welcome to Tim Meusel's talk on Vox Pupuli's journey as a community.

Unfortunately, Tim couldn't make it due to a work-trip. So it's a great honour to return to this stage, and this community, however briefly. Especially because I'm taking Tim's place, who's done so much for us here.

???

* many people write it wrong
* we agreed on Vox Pupuli

It has come to my attention that there seems to be an issue with how Vox Pupuli is pronounced!
Let's start with the basics: Vox Pupuli is a play on the Latin phrase *"Vox Populus"* (the voice of the people) — where *pupuli* means "little puppets".
So it's the voice of little puppets!

Here's how i pronounce it

]

???

To begin with, we are a Collaborative community of Puppet practitioners.
I've stolen this *declaration* from [sous-chefs](http://sous-chefs.org/), which is a Collaborative community of Chef practitioners.
So the good news is: We're not alone in what we do, and how we do that.

???

And what we do, is we maintain *a lot* of puppet modules.
Currently we have 89 modules published on the forge.
And about ~95 in our GitHub organisation, which are being polished up, so they too can be published.

The sheer amount of modules and repositories leads to some challenges, which we will discuss today.

One way to tackle that is to be available 24/7 on IRC (and slack) to help you.
It's our form of Chat-Ops!
It's very important to be present, and responsive.
But we also try very hard to be polite, while being helpful!

By opening our minds to new technologies, and our hearts to new people

ｗｅ   ｇａｉｎ  ｍｏｒｅ   ｆｏｌｌｏｗｅｒｓ

that is… we give people really easy access to our repositories.
This certainly encourages them to pick up our slack ;) but more on that later…

We also encourage users to contribute: If we cannot solve their problems, maybe we can help them fix it themself.

And, finally, we're always happy to play with new software (automation scripts, IRC bots...) or adopt new modules.
Our latest being `rtyler-jenkins`!

???

And as rtyler can most certainly confirm, maintaining a module on your own can be an overwhelming experience.
But it's also a crushing experience for someone to find your module, and notice afterwards that it's unmaintained.

There's a broader issue: For each maintainer, we have ~10 (prospective) contributors.
People who will contribute a code or docs fix, or open issues, or help out with code-review.
And then we have around ~100 users, who are passive and silent.

They might find the barrier to opening an issue harder to surpass, than forking a module internally, or finding a different one, or writing their own.
The reasons might be technical, organizational, or language issues.
But the reason doesn't matter.

We want to provide a home for orphaned modules, to prevent this kind of churn.
And we keep maintainers from burning out, by providing a whole collective of module developers.

Because developing alone sucks.
And there is such hard pressure on a single person, if your module is popular.
Sometimes you just want to go on vacation.
Or you switch jobs, and your new company is all about Ansible.
But you also might lose interest in development altogether, and finally start that alpaca farm you've been dreaming about.

We have many contributors who are new to git and github.
Rebasing a feature branch against upstream master is difficult, if you've never done it.

Many have never written tests, and dealing with rspec/rubocop/beaker is hard as well.
We don't have to teach them writing good puppet code, but all the related tooling.

Many administrators of legacy infrastructures with (Puppet3, Ruby191, Ruby2.0), so we spend a lot of time why we should move on.
Please remember that Puppet2.7 was declared EOL in November 2016.

Can we call Puppet4 legacy already? (bastelfreak: yes pls)

These days, common support cases are:

* There is a strange datatype in my code (puppet4/5 code executed with puppet3)
* Data-in-modules doesn't work

There are three key motivations to why Vox Pupuli was formed, and we've alluded already to most of them:

* Maintaining a module on your own is hard
* Proper testing of a module requires constant vigilance of the changes in the ruby ecosystem

[![no thanks rubocop](images/prettier-ruby.png)](https://twitter.com/hirojin/status/960152015149125632)

But our "hidden" agenda is that we want to push the use of puppet into a modern direction (and mine is to get rid of rubocop)

## How?

### modulesync

.right-column[

* We are managing 92 modules

* We had 75 in november 2016

* modulesync! developed by Morgan Haskell Puppet Inc, moved to Vox Pupuli

* takes config file + templates, throws it into every modules git repo

* Works with GitHub Pull Requests

  * Everybody can start it

  * Every of our Collaborators can approve/merge it

]

???

As the amount of modules grew, we needed a way to manage this.
We decided that our best approach would be to adopt modulesync, which at that time was developed by Morgan Haskell of Puppet, but eventually moved to us, as she grew tired of it ;)

Keeping generic files like Gemfile/Rakefile in sync is pain, if done by hand, and modulesync saves us sooo much time.
It takes a config file + templates, throws it into every module's git repo
It Works with GitHub Pull Requests, so *in theory* everybody can start it, and every of our Collaborators can approve/merge it.

However, it's not very easy to use, and we're looking for ways to make it more comfortable… or a replacement for it.

And this is something we can perhaps look into tomorrow.

Travis is a free CI platform.
Puppet Inc. sponsors us unlimited(?) concurrent travis slots (Thanks to 💜David Schmitt💜), which we really need given all the `rpsec-puppet` tests we test on all common Puppet×Ruby versions.
These days Travis also runs beaker acceptance tests for us.

And, finally, it handles the release process of modules to the Forge.

.right-column[

* Gem called voxpupuli-release

* Upcoming: Also create a github release

]

???

For our release process we use a gem called `voxpupuli-release`. It's essentially a wrapper around `puppet-blacksmith`, and provides rake task to bump + tag a module — after doing the appropriate sanity checks.

The push to the Forge is handled in a `deploy` task on Travis. 
So, in theory everybody can start it, each collaborator can approve it.
They do have to `tag && push --tags` however, so Travis can react to it.
What's still missing is to also create a github release.

So I hope you can see we try hard to encourage users to contribute by providing easy to use tools

Let's talk docs!
Our own docs look a little bit lacking for love, but they do contain everything you need to know to get started, or transfer a module, and, as of recently a Review Guidline (I'll get back to this in a bit)

On the other hand, we have automatically (💜`puppet-strings`💜) generated html docs for a bunch of modules, 
Which are automagically published under our domain.

> 'Release early - release often' - Igor Galić

People are scared to make releases because it could break things.
Release as often as possible. Less changes per release → less broken releases.

> 'Version numbers are cheap - use them' - Igor Galić

People are often scared to merge breaking changes. Merging them is totally okay if you do proper versioning.
We don't delete broken releases and try to fix it, we just do a new release!

> 'DevOps is all about empathy' - Rob Nelson

Working closely together, listening to users, always be constructive, don't blame others for mistakes. we all break stuff from time to time.
