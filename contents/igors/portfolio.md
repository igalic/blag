Here's a small selection of skills I've learned, or roles I've filled in the
past 12 years.


# Open Source

## Puppet

Following my immersion into the world of Puppet, through both the work for my
customers as well as that for Brainsware — my own company's infrastructure, I
became increasingly active in the Puppet community.

2013 I was offered commit access to two of the most used Puppet Labs modules:
[puppetlabs-apache](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache), and
[puppetlabs-mysql](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql).  All the
while producing a lot of my own.

2014, [Daniele Sluijters](https://twitter.com/daenney) and I started
[Voxpupuli](https://voxpupuli.org/) (The voice of the puppets). A space for the
community to entrust popular puppet modules, or related projects, so we don't
have to rely on a single maintainer.

Voxpupuli however, is also a space for the community to serve as a
counterweight to Puppet Inc, or to move at a faster pace than Puppet Inc could:
more aggressively adopting new versions, or exploring new concepts.

Once Voxpupuli had grown to a *considerable* size, we organized votes for a
leadership group. After the votes, Daenney stepped back completely, and I
vanished slowly into the background. The project had taken on life of its own,
but more importantly, it was very vital without its founders.

## JavaScript

After seeing the success of Voxpupuli, and, after presenting its model seeing
other people groups (or [companies](https://www.chef.io/))adopt it, I thought it
was time that we start something like this for JavaScript.
So, [FruitfulJS](https://github.com/fruitfuljs/) was born.

## Apache

I have been an [Apache](https://www.apache.org/) committer since February 2010,
when I joined the [Apache httpd](https://httpd.apache.org/), and shortly
thereafter the [Apache Traffic Server](https://trafficserver.apache.org/)
project. 2012 I became a member.

My contributions to these two projects have been documentation mostly, but also
the odd code fix: I starteed the SNI support in Traffic Server, and added
FreeBSD raw-disk support. I have also devoted a lot of time to Apache Traffic
Server as release manager.

# Dev♥Ops

## Bwin

My first and last *employment* in IT was for [Bwin](http://bwinparty.com/). I
started as a junior, quickly evolving into a more senior position. Among the
dozens of internal services I've been managing, two projects stand out:

-   Concept and implementing of fault tolerant infrastructure for Version
    Control, Continuous Integration and Acceptance Testing
-   Standardization of application servers, central deployment to those, as
    well as automation thereof

I have also actively participated in

-   on-call duty for the entire production landscape running on Solaris & Linux
-   Dozens of applications running on \~60 servers
-   Working closely with developers, testers and managers
-   etc…

Working at Bwin created the foundation of my Operations Persona. I have since
worked as a freelancer in a company I co-founded.

## Brainsware

Not being bound to the classic constraints of an employee I was able to work on
interesting projects that iteratively improved my customers' infrastructure.

A few highlights here

-   Introducing a generalized, centralized, asynchronous, open source logging
    infrastructure (logstash)
-   Introducing package repositories for both the OS and each Programming
    Environment in use (pip, cabal, rubygems, etc…)
-   Assistance in the migration to Git (training of Ops Engineers)
-   Assistance in the rearchitecturing process as well as the implementation of
    the Puppet environment affecting hundreds of machines and dozens of services
-   Consulting developers in matters of messaging architectures
-   Debugging distributed systems and distributed teams
-   Building an Infrastructure Provisioning system

Mid-2014 Brainsware started to develop its own product. This prompted me to
devote more of my time to learning new technologies, such as:

- Lisp, Scheme and Clojure, where I acquired my new found love for REPLs from

- Elixir, Erlang and the BEAM platform which has taught me a lot about failure
  handling and distributed systems

- JavaScript and CoffeeScript, they have taught me more about pain tolerance than m4

- Since all new devops things have to be written in Go these days, there wasn't
  much choice

My primary focus and the reason for expanding my horizons remains on design,
architecture, and usability.

# Trainer and Speaker

Over the course of my consulting practice I have trained colleagues in Git and
Puppet.

I've held a Training on Apache Traffic Server Administration at the [2013
ApacheCon Na](http://na.apachecon.com/), as well as two talks. My public
speaking has vastly improved since:

* I gave a talk on the woes of [cooperation between Developers and
  Operations](https://speakerdeck.com/igalic/building-web-applications-for-the-high-scale)
  engineers at [WebCamp Zagreb 2013](http://2013.webcampzg.org/)

* At Puppetconf 2014 I held a talk about [Puppet Types &
  Providers](https://brainsware.org/blog/8-types-providers)

* I got to talk about Voxpupuli at the Puppet Contributor Summit 2015, and was
  voted one of the MVP finalists at Puppet Conf in that year.

* I've given this Presentation about [Voxpupuli, Open Source Speedtrain](https://blag.esotericsystems.at/igor/presents/voxpupuli-opensource-speedtrain/) at numerous conferences. Sadly it has never been recorded. However, there's a [blog post](https://voxpupuli.org/blog/2016/06/10/voxpupuli-opensource-speedtrain/)
