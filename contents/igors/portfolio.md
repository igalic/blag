Here's a small selection of skills I've learned, or roles I've filled in the
past 10 years.


# Open Source

## Puppet

Following my immersion into the world of Puppet, through both the work for my
customers as well as that for Brainsware's Infrastructure itself I became
increasingly active in the Puppet community.

2013 I was offered commit access to two Puppet Labs modules.  All the while
producing a lot of my own.

2014, [Daniele Sluijters](https://twitter.com/daenney) and I started
[Voxpupuli](https://voxpupuli.org/) (The voice of the puppets). A space for the
community to entrust popular puppet modules, or related projects, so we don't
have to rely on a single maintainer.

Voxpupuli however, is also a space for the community to serve as a
counterweight to Puppetlabs, or to move at a faster pace than Puppetlabs could:
more aggressively adopting new versions, or exploring new concepts.

## Apache

I have been an [Apache](https://www.apache.org/) committer since February 2010,
when I joined the [Apache httpd](https://httpd.apache.org/), and shortly
thereafter the [Apache Traffic Server](https://trafficserver.apache.org/)
project. 2012 I became a member.

My contributions to these two projects have been documentation mostly, but also
the odd code fix: I starteed the SNI support in Traffic Server, and added
FreeBSD raw-disk support. I have also devoted a lot of time to Apache Traffic
Server as release manager.

# Dev♥Ops

## Bwin

My first and last *employment* in IT was for [Bwin](http://bwinparty.com/). I
started as a junior, quickly evolving into a more senior position. Among the
dozens of internal services I've been managing, two projects stand out:

-   Concept and implementing of fault tolerant infrastructure for Version
    Control, Continuous Integration and Acceptance Testing
-   Standardization of application servers, central deployment to those, as
    well as automation thereof

I have also actively participated in

-   on-call duty for the entire production landscape running on Solaris & Linux
-   Dozens of applications running on \~60 servers
-   Working closely with developers, testers and managers
-   etc…

Working at Bwin created the foundation of my Operations Persona. I have since
worked as a freelancer in a company I co-founded.

## Brainsware

Not being bound to the classic constraints of an employee I was able to work on
interesting projects that iteratively improved my customers' infrastructure.

A few highlights here

-   Introducing a generalized, centralized, asynchronous, open source logging
    infrastructure (logstash)
-   Introducing package repositories for both the OS and each Programming
    Environment in use (pip, cabal, rubygems, etc…)
-   Assistance in the migration to Git (training of Ops Engineers)
-   Assistance in the architectural process as well as the implementation of
    the Puppet environment
-   Consulting developers in matters of messaging architectures

Mid-2014 Brainsware started to develop its own product. This prompted me to
devote more of my time to learning new technologies, such as:

- Lisp, Scheme and Clojure, where I acquired my new found love for REPLs from

- Elixir, Erlang and the BEAM platform which has taught me a lot about failure
  handling and distributed systems

- JavaScript and CoffeeScript, they have taught me more about pain tolerance than m4

My primary focus and the reason for expanding my horizons remains on design,
architecture, and usability.

# Trainer and Speaker

Over the course of my consulting practice I have trained colleagues in Git and
Puppet.

I've held a Training on Apache Traffic Server Administration at the [2013
ApacheCon Na](http://na.apachecon.com/), as well as two talks. My public
speaking has vastly improved since:

* I gave a talk on the woes of [cooperation between Developers and
  Operations](https://speakerdeck.com/igalic/building-web-applications-for-the-high-scale)
  engineers at [WebCamp Zagreb 2013](http://2013.webcampzg.org/)

* At Puppetconf 2014 I held a talk about [Puppet Types &
  Providers](https://brainsware.org/blog/8-types-providers)

* At the 2015 Puppetconf I got to talk about Voxpupuli at the Contributor
  Summit, and was one of the MVP finalists.
