Education
---------

I attended the [Technical College Spengergasse, for IT and organization](http://www.spengergasse.at/) for 7 years, failing every uneven year. In an attempt to finish what I had started, I attended the same school's evening college for a semester until it had finally sunk in: I *hate* the education system.

Fortunately those 7 years were not entirely wasted. I learned a lot of what I consider 'basics'. The method of learning I evolved has followed me throughout my career and into my personal life: Complete devotion and immersion into a subject.

Experience
----------

### Site Reliability Engineer at Bwin International Entertainment AG, 2007--2011

My first and last employment in IT. I started as a junior, but quickly evolved into a senior position. Among the dozens of internal services I've been managing, two projects stand out:

-   Concept and implementing of fault tolerant infrastructure for Version Control, Continuous Integration and Acceptance Testing

-   Standardization of application servers, central deployment to those, as well as automation thereof

I have also actively participated in

-   on-call duty for the entire production landscape running on Solaris & Linux
-   Dozens of applications running on \~60 servers
-   Working closely with developers, testers and managers
-   to bring complex JEE applications using
-   a number of frameworks such as Spring and Hibernate as well as Tibco JMS
-   running in JBoss 4 and JBoss 5
-   from development to test to production.
-   Performance bottleneck analysis of such applications

Working at Bwin created the foundation of my Operations Persona, but it ultimately led to a burn out and a six months hiatus from working, where I more strongly focused on

### Open Source (Apache Software Foundation 2010--)

I have been an Apache committer since February 2010, when I joined the Apache httpd, and shortly thereafter the Apache Traffic Server project. 2012 I became a member. However, I don't even remember when I started actively supporting the community and contributing fixes.

My contributions to these two projects have been documentation mostly, but also the odd code fix. I have devoted a lot of time to Apache Traffic Server as release manager (cat herder).

### Consulting (via Brainsware OG for various customers 2012--)

In the beginning of 2012 I became officially self-employed, offering my skills for hire.

Not being bound to the classic constraints of an employee I was able to work on interesting projects that iteratively improved my customers' infrastructure.

A few highlights here

-   Introducing a generalized, centralized, asynchronous, open source logging infrastructure (logstash)
-   Introducing package repositories for both the OS and each Programming Environment in use
-   Assistance in the migration to Git (training of Ops Engineers)
-   Assistance in the architectural process as well as the implementation of the Puppet environment
-   Consulting developers in matters of messaging architectures

### Open Source (Puppet Labs 2013--)

Following my immersion into the world of Puppet, through both the work for my customers as well as that for Brainsware's Infrastructure itself I became increasingly active in the Puppet community.

2013 I was offered commit access to two Puppet Labs modules.

-   [puppetlabs/apache](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache)
-   [puppetlabs/mysql](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql)

All the while producing a lot of my own

-   [Brainsware/trafficserver](https://github.com/Brainsware/puppet-trafficserver)
-   [Brainsware/crashdump](https://github.com/Brainsware/puppet-crashdump)
-   [Brainsware/composer](https://github.com/Brainsware/puppet-composer)
-   [Brainsware/rsyslog](https://github.com/Brainsware/puppet-rsyslog)

### Trainer and Speaker

Throughout my entire career I have *always* been training my fellow colleagues. This has started with teaching C programming to lower-class mates while still attending school. It continued with basic training on Version Control Software in Bwin, as well as Shell scripting, basic and advanced Unix know-how, as well as Performance Optimization on Solaris and the JVM.

Over the course of my consulting practice I have trained colleagues in Git and Puppet. Since the emergence of the cloud no one wants to hear about performance issues anymore, so I'm keeping that to myself.

I've held a Training on Apache Traffic Server Administration at the [2013 ApacheCon Na](http://na.apachecon.com/), as well as two talks. Fortunately my public speaking has improved since: I gave a talk on the woes of [cooperation between Developers and Operations](https://speakerdeck.com/igalic/building-web-applications-for-the-high-scale) engineers at [WebCamp Zagreb 2013](http://2013.webcampzg.org/)
